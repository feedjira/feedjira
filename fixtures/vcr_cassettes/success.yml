            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I took Feedjira to &lt;a href="http://feedjira.com/blog/2014/03/17/feedjira-goes-one-point-oh.html"&gt;version 1.0&lt;/a&gt; and today I&amp;rsquo;m releasing
        version 2.0. Not much has changed actually - the biggest difference is that
        &lt;code&gt;curb&lt;/code&gt; has been replaced with &lt;code&gt;faraday&lt;/code&gt;. For many users, upgrading to version
        2.0 won&amp;rsquo;t require anything more than a &lt;code&gt;bundle update feedjira&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The other big change is that the &lt;code&gt;Feedjira#update&lt;/code&gt; method was removed. It was
        unreliable and mostly just caused issues. To read more about why this was
        removed, check out &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/issues/218#issuecomment-40282091"&gt;this comment&lt;/a&gt; on a GitHub issue that was opened
        about it not working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also updated the site to reflect the changes in this version. I took the
        opportunity to greatly simply things and got just about all the documentation to
        fit on one page.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I hope you like version 2.0 - feel free to hit me up &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/feedjira"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or if
        you have any trouble, open a &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/issues"&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a hand.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Finally, thanks to those that gave me feedback on either my thoughts on version
        2.0 or the release candidate - I really appreciate it!&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;TLDR: development of version 2.0 is being done on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/tree/two-point-oh"&gt;two-point-oh branch&lt;/a&gt;
        and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/issues/221"&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; is open for you to give feedback on its direction.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve starting work on a rewrite for Feedjira and I wanted to try using a &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/issues/221"&gt;GitHub
        issue&lt;/a&gt; to discuss what I&amp;rsquo;d like to see in the new version. I&amp;rsquo;m very
        interested in what users think, so please chime in!!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In no particular order, here are some design goals for the new version:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Change HTTP Library&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This gem depends on &lt;a href="https://github.com/taf2/curb"&gt;curb&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to switch that to something that will
        allow me to support JRuby. I did some experimenting and really liked working
        with &lt;a href="https://github.com/lostisland/faraday"&gt;Faraday&lt;/a&gt;, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m using at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Forget Concurrency&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Throwing an array of feed urls at Feedjira and watching it concurrently fetch
        and parse them extremely quickly is cool in READMEs and demos, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think
        it&amp;rsquo;s reality. I think what&amp;rsquo;s much more likely is a single url being passed and
        concurrency being dealt with in the application, workers being the likely
        approach.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;More Objects&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Feedjira has a dirty little secret and it&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;code&gt;Feedjira::Feed&lt;/code&gt; class. If you
        open that sucker up, you&amp;rsquo;ll see 19 class methods and 0 instance methods. These
        class methods do everything from fetching and parsing to setting up curb and
        unzipping raw xml. Not only is &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"&gt;SRP&lt;/a&gt; off in the corner crying, its a mess to
        test. I&amp;rsquo;d like to break this down into smaller objects that get instantiated and
        passed around in normal OO fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Fewer Parsers&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the things I like best about Feedjira is the ability for a user to define
        their own custom parsers and I think its under-used. What I&amp;rsquo;d like to see is
        Feedjira ship with a parser for Atom and a parser for RSS - the others are
        really just custom parsers.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Custom Parser Project&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With version 1.2, I was able to spin off the benchmarks into &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira-benchmarks"&gt;their own
        project&lt;/a&gt; and I was very happy with how it turned out - I&amp;rsquo;d like to see a
        similar thing happen with the custom parsers mentioned above. You should be able
        to easily grab these parsers and throw them in your application. If you write a
        particularly cool custom parser, then you could contribute it back and others
        could benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Raise Exceptions Instead of Callbacks&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Feedjira almost never raises an exception and instead provides the ability to
        register callbacks for success and failure situations, but this has proven
        brittle and painful. With the new version, I want to see sensible exceptions
        raised when something goes wrong and that pretty much removes the need for
        callbacks, so those will be cut.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Feed Updating is Business Logic&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The updating functionality of Feedjira leaves a lot to be desired - its
        inconsistent and there are lots of edges. I tend to steer users away and
        encourage them to write this kind of code in their application instead. See
        &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/issues/218"&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt; for more, but needless to say, I&amp;rsquo;d like to see this entire
        feature set removed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I want configuration for Feedjira done in a proper config block like most gems.
        If you want to change the default parsers, that should be a config option. If
        you want to set the user agent, that should be a configuration option.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Feedback Appreciated&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Do you have any other ideas to make Feedjira better? Please check out the
        &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/issues/221"&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; and share what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking. I&amp;rsquo;m open to any feedback, so
        if I just threw your favorite feature on the chopping block, please tell me!&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the release of version 1.2.0, the benchmarks for Feedjira have been moved
        to a separate project: &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira-benchmarks"&gt;https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira-benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s nice about this is that it keeps things much more organized and allowed
        me to add a pretty neat new benchmark - more on that in a moment. I also rewrote
        the &lt;a href="/benchmarks.html"&gt;Benchmarks page&lt;/a&gt; on this site so please check that out.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One benchmark that I didn&amp;rsquo;t pull over to the new project is the fetching one. I
        left it out because it relied on the consistency of your network connection and
        that didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it was scientific enough.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In its place I&amp;rsquo;ve added a benchmark for parsing speed that&amp;rsquo;s run against each
        version of the gem. Its pretty cool - when you clone down the
        feedjira-benchmarks project, you also clone down feedjira itself and then the
        script moves to each version tag in the git repo, runs the benchmark and records
        the results. It was pretty fun to write and works like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For the charts, I ended up learning some &lt;a href="http://www.r-project.org/"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; so that I could have a little
        more control.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Benchmarks are really only valuable if they can be reproduced by others, so I&amp;rsquo;ve
        written up instructions in the README for setting things up and running them. If
        you&amp;rsquo;re interested, take a look and try running them yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to use the benchmarks to ensure Feedjira stays fast, so you wont
        have to worry about your favorite Ruby feed library slowing down. If you have
        any feedback for me on the benchmarks, feel free to hit me up on Twitter
        (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/feedjira"&gt;@feedjira&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira-benchmarks/issues"&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; on the project&amp;rsquo;s repo.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last fall, I asked &lt;a href="http://www.pauldix.net"&gt;Paul Dix&lt;/a&gt; if I could take over maintenance of his gem
        Feedzirra. My request was totally out of the blue, so I was pretty pumped when
        he got right back to me and said yes. He said that he didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to work
        on it anymore and so I should feel free to do whatever I thought was best.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Score!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My first order of business was to go through the many open issues and pull
        requests on GitHub. When I started there were over 60, a number that I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten
        down to just a few. I thought it was important to ensure that users saw me treat
        their issue as important and even if it was very old (which many were), I asked
        if there was anything I could do to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by the nice way many people responded and we got to
        work addressing their questions and issues.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As I was working through issues and pull requests, I kept &lt;a href="http://semver.org"&gt;SemVer&lt;/a&gt; in mind -
        bug fixes in patch releases and backward-compatible changes in minor releases.
        But I also realized that it was past time for this project to be at version 1.0.
        In the SemVer FAQ, they talk about when to release version 1.0 and Feedzirra fit
        the bill: it was being used in production, there was a stable API and I was
        taking backwards compatibilty seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;So I treated it as a project at 1.0 and I did my best to release versions that
        were backward compatible and added deprecations for what I wanted to do in 1.0.
        I saw things that I wanted to completely rewrite, but I resisted the urge to
        burn it all down and start again.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When I was close to being caught up on the backlog of issues and pull requests,
        I started thinking about releasing version 1.0, and I knew I wanted to create a
        website for the project. I worked with &lt;a href="http://danielariza.com"&gt;Daniel Ariza&lt;/a&gt; to make it happen. I
        ripped apart the README and rewrote just about all the sections.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;There was an open issue on the project about renaming the Gem and I knew that
        launching the website and releasing 1.0 would be the perfect opportunity, so I
        went for it. There was a suggestion to change the name to Feedzilla, but since
        that is already a thing, I went with Feedjira. I bought the domain and setup an
        organization by that name on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With those things in place, I needed to actually update the code for these
        changes. I wanted to make this transition as easy as possible and devised a
        simple way to use &lt;a href="/versions.html"&gt;three versions&lt;/a&gt; to make the jump to 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;For most users, upgrading to 1.0 should be a breeze, but I have an &lt;a href="/upgrading.html"&gt;upgrade
        page&lt;/a&gt; to help with a couple details. If you have any trouble upgrading,
        please let me know by &lt;a href="https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira/issues"&gt;opening an issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;There are still lots of things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do with this Gem. I mentioned seeing
        things that I wanted to completely rewrite, so that&amp;rsquo;ll be something that I work
        on for a 2.0 release, but that&amp;rsquo;s a ways off. I&amp;rsquo;d like to officially support
        JRuby. Many people use Feedjira with Rails, so a separate project that helps
        those users get up and running quickly seems to have value.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I do have a request before I finish this thing: I&amp;rsquo;d like to hear from users that
        have apps in production using Feedjira. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Feedjira for a
        commercial app, please &lt;a href="feedjira@gmail.com"&gt;email me&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who has helped me accomplish this, but especially &lt;a href="http://www.pauldix.net"&gt;Paul
        Dix&lt;/a&gt; for creating such a fun project to work on, &lt;a href="http://danielariza.com"&gt;Daniel Ariza&lt;/a&gt; for a
        badass website design and the many people who opened issues or sent pull
        requests. Open source is fun to work on because of people like you!! &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3 &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

Feedjira is a Ruby library designed to parse feeds.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "feedjira"
```

## Parsing

An example of parsing a feed with Feedjira:

```ruby
xml = HTTParty.get(url).body
feed = Feedjira::Feed.parse xml
feed.entries.first.title
# => "Announcing verison 1.0"
```

## Adding a feed parsing class

When determining which parser to use for a given XML document, the following
list of parser classes is used:

* `Feedjira::Parser::RSSFeedBurner`
* `Feedjira::Parser::GoogleDocsAtom`
* `Feedjira::Parser::AtomFeedBurner`
* `Feedjira::Parser::Atom`
* `Feedjira::Parser::ITunesRSS`
* `Feedjira::Parser::RSS`
* `Feedjira::Parser::JSONFeed`

You can insert your own parser at the front of this stack by calling
`add_feed_class`, like this:

```ruby
Feedjira::Feed.add_feed_class(MyAwesomeParser)
```

Now when you `parse`, `MyAwesomeParser` will be the first one to get a
chance to parse the feed.

If you have the XML and just want to provide a parser class for one parse, you
can specify that using `parse_with`:

```ruby
Feedjira::Feed.parse_with(MyAwesomeParser, xml)
```

## Adding attributes to all feeds types / all entries types

```ruby
# Add the generator attribute to all feed types
Feedjira::Feed.add_common_feed_element("generator")
xml = HTTParty.get("http://www.pauldix.net/atom.xml").body
Feedjira::Feed.parse(xml).generator
# => "TypePad"
```

## Adding attributes to only one class

If you want to add attributes for only one class you simply have to declare them
in the class

```ruby
# Add some GeoRss information
class Feedjira::Parser::RSSEntry
  element "georss:elevation", as: :elevation
end

# Fetch a feed containing GeoRss info and print them
url = "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/significant_week.atom"
xml = HTTParty.get(url).body
Feedjira::Feed.parse(xml).entries.each do |entry|
  puts "Elevation: #{entry.elevation}"
end
```

## Configuration

#### Parsers

Feedjira can be configured to use a specific set of parsers and in a specific order:

```ruby
Feedjira.configure do |config|
  config.parsers = [
    Feedjira::Parser::ITunesRSS,
    MyAwesomeParser,
    Feedjira::Parser::RSS
  ]
end
```

#### Stripping whitespace from XML

Feedjira can be configured to strip all whitespace but defaults to lstrip only:

```ruby
Feedjira.configure do |config|
  config.strip_whitespace = true
end
```

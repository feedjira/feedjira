Feedjira (formerly Feedzirra) is a Ruby library designed to fetch and parse
feeds as quickly as possible.

## Getting Started

Feedjira is tested with Ruby version 1.9.3 and 2.x so like any Ruby gem, the
first step is to install the gem:

```
$ gem install feedjira
```

Or add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "feedjira"
```

## Fetching and Parsing

For many users, the `fetch_and_parse` method is what they use Feedjira for. This
method takes a url and returns a Parser object:

```ruby
url = "http://feedjira.com/blog/feed.xml"
feed = Feedjira::Feed.fetch_and_parse(url)
# => #<Feedjira::Parser::Atom...>
```

These feed objects have both the meta data for a feed and an `entries`
collection that contains all the entries that were found:

```ruby
feed.title
# => "Feedjira Blog"
feed.url
# => "http://feedjira.com/blog"
feed.entries # returns an array of Entry objects
# => [<Feedjira::Feed::Entry ...>, <Feedjira::Feed::Entry ...>, ...]
```

These entry objects contain the data parsed from the feed XML:

```ruby
entry = feed.entries.first
entry.title
# => "Announcing verison 1.0"
entry.url
# => "http://feedjira.com/blog/2014-02-12-announcing-version-10.html"
```

## Just Parsing

The parsing functionality of Feedjira has been exposed so that it can be used in
isolation:

```ruby
xml = Faraday.get(url).body
feed = Feedjira::Feed.parse xml
feed.entries.first.title
# => "Announcing verison 1.0"
```

## Adding a feed parsing class

When determining which parser to use for a given XML document, the following
list of parser classes is used:

* `Feedjira::Parser::RSSFeedBurner`
* `Feedjira::Parser::GoogleDocsAtom`
* `Feedjira::Parser::AtomFeedBurner`
* `Feedjira::Parser::Atom`
* `Feedjira::Parser::ITunesRSS`
* `Feedjira::Parser::RSS`

You can insert your own parser at the front of this stack by calling
`add_feed_class`, like this:

```ruby
Feedjira::Feed.add_feed_class(MyAwesomeParser)
```

Now when you `fetch_and_parse`, `MyAwesomeParser` will be the first one to get a
chance to parse the feed.

If you have the XML and just want to provide a parser class for one parse, you
can specify that using `parse_with`:

```ruby
Feedjira::Feed.parse_with(MyAwesomeParser, xml)
```

## Adding attributes to all feeds types / all entries types

```ruby
# Add the generator attribute to all feed types
Feedjira::Feed.add_common_feed_element("generator")
Feedjira::Feed.fetch_and_parse("http://www.pauldix.net/atom.xml").generator
# => "TypePad"
```

## Adding attributes to only one class

If you want to add attributes for only one class you simply have to declare them
in the class

```ruby
# Add some GeoRss information
class Feedjira::Parser::RSSEntry
  element "georss:elevation", as: :elevation
end

# Fetch a feed containing GeoRss info and print them
url = "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/significant_week.atom"
Feedjira::Feed.fetch_and_parse(url).entries.each do |entry|
  puts "Elevation: #{entry.elevation}"
end
```

## Configuration

Feedjira configuration options can be set by using a block

```ruby
Feedjira.configure do |config|
  config.strip_whitespace = true
end
```

## Testing

Feedjira uses [faraday][] to perform requests, so testing Feedjira is really
about [stubbing out faraday requests][stub].

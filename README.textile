h1. Feedzirra

"http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/tree/master":http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/tree/master 

I'd like feedback on the api and any bugs encountered on feeds in the wild. I've set up a "google group here":http://groups.google.com/group/feedzirra.

h2. Summary

A feed fetching and parsing library that treats the internet like Godzilla treats Japan: it dominates and eats all.

h2. Description

Feedzirra is a feed library that is designed to get and update many feeds as quickly as possible. This includes using libcurl-multi through the "taf2-curb":http://github.com/taf2/curb/tree/master gem for faster http gets, and libxml through "nokogiri":http://github.com/tenderlove/nokogiri/tree/master and "sax-machine":http://github.com/pauldix/sax-machine/tree/master for faster parsing.

Once you have fetched feeds using Feedzirra, they can be updated using the feed objects. Feedzirra automatically inserts etag and last-modified information from the http response headers to lower bandwidth usage, eliminate unnecessary parsing, and make things speedier in general.

Another feature present in Feedzirra is the ability to create callback functions that get called "on success" and "on failure" when getting a feed. This makes it easy to do things like log errors or update data stores.

The fetching and parsing logic have been decoupled so that either of them can be used in isolation if you'd prefer not to use everything that Feedzirra offers. However, the code examples below use helper methods in the Feed class that put everything together to make things as simple as possible.

The final feature of Feedzirra is the ability to define custom parsing classes. In truth, Feedzirra could be used to parse much more than feeds. Microformats, page scraping, and almost anything else are fair game.

h2. Installation

For now Feedzirra exists only on github. It also has a few gem requirements that are only on github. Before you start you need to have "libcurl":http://curl.haxx.se/ and "libxml":http://xmlsoft.org/ installed. If you're on Leopard you have both. Otherwise, you'll need to grab them. Once you've got those libraries, these are the gems that get used: nokogiri, pauldix-sax-machine, taf2-curb, and pauldix-feedzirra. The feedzirra gemspec has all the dependencies so you should be able to get up and running with the standard github gem install routine:
<pre>
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com # if you haven't already
gem install pauldix-feedzirra
</pre>

h2. Usage

"A gist of the following code":http://gist.github.com/57285
<pre>
require 'feedzirra'

# fetching a single feed
feed = Feedzirra::Feed.fetch_and_parse("http://feeds.feedburner.com/PaulDixExplainsNothing")

# feed and entries accessors
feed.title          # => "Paul Dix Explains Nothing"
feed.url            # => "http://www.pauldix.net"
feed.feed_url       # => "http://feeds.feedburner.com/PaulDixExplainsNothing"
feed.etag           # => "GunxqnEP4NeYhrqq9TyVKTuDnh0"
feed.last_modified  # => Sat Jan 31 17:58:16 -0500 2009 # it's a Time object

entry = feed.entries.first
entry.title      # => "Ruby Http Client Library Performance"
entry.url        # => "http://www.pauldix.net/2009/01/ruby-http-client-library-performance.html"
entry.author     # => "Paul Dix"
entry.summary    # => "..."
entry.content    # => "..."
entry.published  # => Thu Jan 29 17:00:19 UTC 2009 # it's a Time object

# updating a single feed
updated_feed = Feedzirra::Feed.update(feed)

# an updated feed has the following extra accessors
updated_feed.updated?     # returns true if any of the feed attributes have been modified. will return false if only new entries
updated_feed.new_entries  # a collection of the entry objects that are newer than the latest in the feed before update

# fetching multiple feeds
feed_urls = ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/PaulDixExplainsNothing", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/trottercashion"]
feeds = Feedzirra::Feed.fetch_and_parse(feeds_urls)

# feeds is now a hash with the feed_urls as keys and the parsed feed objects as values. If an error was thrown
# there will be a Fixnum of the http response code instead of a feed object

# updating multiple feeds. it expects a collection of feed objects
updated_feeds = Feedzirra::Feed.udpate(feeds.values)

# defining custom behavior on failure or success. note that a return status of 304 (not updated) will call the on_success handler
feed = Feedzirra::Feed.fetch_and_parse("http://feeds.feedburner.com/PaulDixExplainsNothing",
	:on_success => lambda {|feed| puts feed.title },
	:on_failure => lambda {|url, response_code, response_header, response_body| puts response_body })
# if a collection was passed into fetch_and_parse, the handlers will be called for each one

# the behavior for the handlers when using Feedzirra::Feed.update is slightly different. The feed passed into on_success will be
# the updated feed with the standard updated accessors. on failure it will be the original feed object passed into update

# Defining custom parsers
# TODO: the functionality is here, just write some good examples that show how to do this
</pre>

h2. Benchmarks

One of the goals of Feedzirra is speed. This includes not only parsing, but fetching multiple feeds as quickly as possible. I ran a benchmark getting 20 feeds 10 times using Feedzirra, rFeedParser, and FeedNormalizer. For more details the "benchmark code can be found in the project in spec/benchmarks/feedzirra_benchmarks.rb":http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/blob/7fb5634c5c16e9c6ec971767b462c6518cd55f5d/spec/benchmarks/feedzirra_benchmarks.rb
<pre>
feedzirra          5.170000   1.290000   6.460000 ( 18.917796)
rfeedparser      104.260000  12.220000 116.480000 (244.799063)
feed-normalizer   66.250000   4.010000  70.260000 (191.589862)
</pre>
The result of that benchmark is a bit sketchy because of the network variability. Running 10 times against the same 20 feeds was meant to smooth some of that out. However, there is also a "benchmark comparing parsing speed in spec/benchmarks/parsing_benchmark.rb":http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/blob/7fb5634c5c16e9c6ec971767b462c6518cd55f5d/spec/benchmarks/parsing_benchmark.rb on an atom feed.
<pre>
feedzirra        0.500000   0.030000   0.530000 (  0.658744)
rfeedparser      8.400000   1.110000   9.510000 ( 11.839827)
feed-normalizer  5.980000   0.160000   6.140000 (  7.576140)
</pre>
There's also a "benchmark that shows the results of using Feedzirra to perform updates on feeds":http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra/blob/45d64319544c61a4c9eb9f7f825c73b9f9030cb3/spec/benchmarks/updating_benchmarks.rb you've already pulled in. I tested against 179 feeds. The first is the initial pull and the second is an update 65 seconds later. I'm not sure how many of them support etag and last-modified, so performance may be better or worse depending on what feeds you're requesting.
<pre>
feedzirra fetch and parse  4.010000   0.710000   4.720000 ( 15.110101)
feedzirra update           0.660000   0.280000   0.940000 (  5.152709)
</pre>

h2. Next Steps

This thing needs to hammer on many different feeds in the wild. I'm sure there will be bugs. I want to find them and crush them. I didn't bother using the test suite for feedparser. i wanted to start fresh.

Here are some more specific todos.
* Make a feedzirra-rails gem to integrate feedzirra seamlessly with Rails and ActiveRecord.
* Add support to automatically handle gzip and deflate encododing.
* Add support for authenticated feeds.
* Create a super sweet DSL for defining new parsers.
* Test against Ruby 1.9.1 and fix any bugs.
* I'm not keeping track of modified on entries. Should I add this?
* Clean up the fetching code inside feed.rb so it doesn't suck so hard.
* Make the feed_spec actually mock stuff out so it doesn't hit the net.
* Readdress how feeds determine if they can parse a document. Maybe I should use namespaces instead?

module Oga
  module XPath
    # Lexer for turning XPath expressions into a set of tokens. Tokens are
    # returned as arrays with every array having two values:
    #
    # 1. The token type as a symbol
    # 2. The token value or nil if there is no value
    #
    # Basic usage of this lexer is as following:
    #
    #     lexer  = Oga::XPath::Lexer.new('//foo/bar')
    #     tokens = lexer.lex
    #
    # Alternatively you can stream tokens instead of returning them as a whole:
    #
    #     lexer = Oga::XPath::Lexer.new('//foo/bar')
    #
    #     lexer.advance do |type, value|
    #
    #     end
    #
    # Unlike the XML lexer the XPath lexer does not support IO instances, it can
    # only lex strings.
    #
    # ## Thread Safety
    #
    # This class keeps track of an internal state. As a result it's not safe to
    # share a single instance between multiple threads. However, you're free to
    # use separate instances per thread as there is no global (= class level)
    # shared state.

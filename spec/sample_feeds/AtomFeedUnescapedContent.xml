<p>I have always been one to support American made products, but before reading the story of <a href="http://www.konaschips.com/Story.asp" target="_blank">Kona</a> I had no idea just how dangerous products that are&#0160;foreign made&#0160;can be.&#0160; There have been several recalls on China produced dog treats and food&#0160;which means many, many pets have become ill or even passed away from consuming these products.&#0160;</p>
<p>Kona, a Pomeranian, was one of the dogs sickened by these China made&#0160;treats.&#0160; His owners refused to let this happen again, but had a hard time finding treats that were 100% made in the U.S.A., so, <a href="http://www.konaschips.com/Index.asp" target="_blank">Kona&#39;s Chips</a> was born.</p>
<p>Offering only 100% made in the U.S.A. products <a href="http://www.konaschips.com/Index.asp" target="_blank">Kona&#39;s Chips</a> has a wonderful line of treats, supplements and toys.&#0160; From the <a href="http://www.konaschips.com/DogJerky.asp" target="_blank">Chicken Jerky</a> to the <a href="http://www.konaschips.com/DogJerky.asp#LiverLicks" target="_blank">Liver Licks</a> to the <a href="http://www.konaschips.com/Krispies.asp" target="_blank">Chicken Krispies</a> you can&#39;t go wrong.&#0160; If my dog could do flips, he would do several to get a taste of these products.&#0160; He just loves them!!&#0160; He often takes&#0160;a piece of the&#0160;<a href="http://www.konaschips.com/DogJerky.asp" target="_blank">Chicken Jerky</a> and tosses up in the air several&#0160;times before laying down and devouring it.&#0160; <a href="http://www.konaschips.com/Index.asp" target="_blank">Kona&#39;s Chips</a>&#0160;has quickly risen to the favorite treat in my house, they have a new customer for life!&#0160;</p>

<p>My dog loves to chew and this is the most durable product I have found yet.&#0160; I am used to him destroying chew toys in a matter of days, some in a matter of minutes.&#0160; Almost two weeks of&#0160;chewing on this&#0160;stick&#0160;and I barely notice a difference in the way the products looks!&#0160;</p>

<p>Perhaps the most misunderstood breed out there is the Pit Bull breed.&#0160; Their loyalty to their owner and their will to please is often taken advantage of, giving this wonderful breed one of the worst names out there.&#0160; I happen to have a very&#0160;special place in my heart for Pit Bulls and after having to put mine down late last year&#0160;due to&#0160;cancer that place is even larger.</p>
<p>I saw these biker themed shirts by <a href="http://www.tommypopart.com/pitbullshirt.html" target="_blank">PitbullShirt.com</a>&#0160;in a magazine and being the dog/Pit Bull fanatic that I am, I had to check them out.&#0160; The fellow Pit Bull lovers very graciously sent me the <a href="http://www.tommypopart.com/pitbullshirt.html" target="_blank">NCY Motorcycle Pub Babydoll T-Shirt</a> and I just&#0160;adore it.&#0160; It isn&#39;t often the Secret Shoppers get to review products for themselves, so that, combined with the perfect fit&#0160;makes it all the better!&#0160; Now I have a stylish&#0160;way to let others know that I support the breed!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tommypopart.com/pitbullshirt.html" target="_blank">Pitbullshirt.com</a>&#0160;has all original designs created by Tommy Athanasiou of <a href="http://www.tommypopart.com/gallery.html" target="_blank">Tommy Pop Art</a>.&#0160; They donate 10% of all proceeds to their chosen&#0160;pit bull&#0160;rescue of the month.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tommypopart.com/pitbullshirt.html" target="_blank">NYC Motorcycle Pub Babydoll T-Shirt</a> runs $25 and can be purchased (along with many other&#0160;styles)&#0160;directly off the <a href="http://www.tommypopart.com/pitbullshirt.html" target="_blank">PitbullShirt.com </a>website.</p>

<p>I recently got a new puppy,&#0160;lab/golden retriever mix, I have been hoping he likes&#0160;to swim&#0160;so I can teach him to fetch from the water.&#0160; This it the perfect toy for that and in Colorado the perfect weather isn&#39;t too far away.</p>
<p>My dog absolutely loves to fetch this toy, BUT I do have to watch him with it as he also thinks it makes a great chew toy.&#0160; Although this fetch toy is durable it is not intended to be used as a chew toy. So, I make sure that if we aren&#39;t playing fetch it is put away.</p>

<p>Who is Katie, you might be wondering?&#0160; <a href="http://www.katiesbumpers.com/" target="_self">Katie&#39;s Bumpers</a>&#0160;is named after a very special family dog, a Newfoundland.&#0160;&#0160;She was a working dog, a water rescue dog and&#0160;earned all of her titles among the Newfoundland&#0160;community.&#0160; Through an animal communicator she&#0160;let it be known that the bumpers she had been&#0160;trained to retrieve&#0160;from the water are hard to see.&#0160; Not too long after this <a href="http://www.katiesbumpers.com/" target="_blank">Katie&#39;s Bumpers </a>was launched.</p>

<p>With all these choices and knowing that I can feel good about giving these products to my dog I wanted to know what he thought!&#0160; I started off with the <a href="http://www.n-bone.com/product_detail.asp?product_id=37" target="_blank">Get Naked Puppy Health Dental Chews</a>, after taking the treat and running to his favorite spot he happily gobbled it down.&#0160; Next I tried the <a href="http://www.n-bone.com/product_detail.asp?product_id=27" target="_blank">PupperNutter N-Bone</a> and he could not be stopped.&#0160; He laid right along the edge of the couch and chewed until there was no more to chew.&#0160; I am thrilled that I found a product that meets all my requirements and my dogs seems to go bananas for.</p>

<p>They sent something in for review that I have been desperately needing, a toy box for my dogs toys.&#0160; I had been using my dogs bed to store his toys in, but it was getting consumed and I realized my dog started to lay next to his bed instead of on his bed.&#0160; Not to mention I would find dog toys in the kids toy box and kids toys in the dogs bed.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.glamourdog.com/pge-toy-cub.html" target="_blank">Puppy&#39;s Toy Storage Box</a> from Glamour Dog is truly a solution to this problem.&#0160;</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>At a spacious 16&quot; X 16&quot; X 16&quot; this toy box has more than enough room for all of my dogs toys.&#0160; I actually stored his bath towels under the toys so it was easier for him to get out what he wanted.&#0160; As you can see all he has to do is stick his head in and pick something out.&#0160; The <a href="http://www.glamourdog.com/pge-toy-cub.html" target="_blank">Puppy&#39;s Toy Storage Box</a> is also fully collapsible to slide away for easy storage if needed.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Available online at <a href="http://www.glamourdog.com/pge-toy-cub.html" target="_blank">GlamourDog.com</a> for $19.95, comes in blue, black, purple and pink.</p>

<p>While visiting a friend recently I noticed that she had a raised feeder for her dog.&#0160; I thought it was just for looks, but she went on to explain that her vet had recommended it to her.&#0160; A few years back she had a German Shepherd that passed away suddenly because of bloat.&#0160; Before she got her new Shepherd mix she called her vet to see what she could do to try and prevent this from happening again.&#0160; One of the things that was mentioned to her was a <a href="http://www.dishydog.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=18&amp;chapter=0" target="_blank">raised feeding</a> system.</p>
<div>The raised feeder are supposed to help lessen the amount of air swallowed by a dog during feeding time which in return helps the digestion process.&#0160; Therefore, the risk of bloat is minimized.&#0160; The raised feeders also help to maintain a good posture and put less strain on the joints.</div>
<p>I have a Lab/Retriever mix and while not top of the list for risk of bloat I don&#39;t like to take chances.&#0160; Especially with the way my dog inhales his food.&#0160; I found <a href="http://www.dishydog.com/" target="_blank">Dishy Dog</a> and could not be happier with the product I received.&#0160; If nothing else, my dog looks happier with a more natural stance when he eats now.</p>
<div><br /></div>
<div>
<div style="float:right"><a href="http://www.dishydog.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=71&amp;products_id=229" target="_blank" title="Double Dish Diner"> <img alt="12_inch_large_thumb" class="at-xid-6a010535222d03970c014e60f045f9970c" height="190" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c014e60f045f9970c-pi" style="margin-left: 5px;" title="Double Dishy Diner" width="218" /></a></div>
</div>
<div>The <a href="http://www.dishydog.com/" target="_blank">Dishy Dog Diner</a> also helps to keep eating areas cleaner by keeping the food and water in the bowl and not around the bowl.&#0160; The bowls are removable and dishwasher safe.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><a href="http://www.dishydog.com/" target="_blank">Dishy Diners</a> are available for both cats and dogs and come with an option of one, two or three <a href="http://www.dishydog.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=77" target="_blank">bowls</a> and of course come in a variety of different heights.&#0160; They can be purchased online from <a href="http://www.dishydog.com/" target="_blank">Dishy Dog</a> (or from several different <a href="http://www.dishydog.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=19&amp;chapter=0" target="_blank">pet stores</a>) and retail starting at about $40.00.<br /></div>

<p>We haven&#39;t had a chance to taste it, but don&#39;t put it past us.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Longtime cat and dog adoption advocate and pet food maker, <a href="tp://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;236874486;60003793;p;pc=[TPAS_ID]" target="_blank" title="Pedigree dog food">PedigreeÂ®</a>, has retooled their recipe, and the result is... extra nutritious, just as tasty. (At least the latter is what we hear.)</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="tp://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;236874486;60003793;p;pc=[TPAS_ID]" target="_blank" title="Pedigree dog food">Pedigree</a>, created its new dog food formulation on recommendations out of the WalthamÂ® Centre for Pet Nutrition, which identified four Universal Needs of Dogs: healthy skin/coat, preventative oral care, good digestion, and a strong immune system. In other words, when your pup receives the nutrition he needs to fuel these four areas, and you have the foundation for a happy, healthy pet.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Makes sense to us. Like with humans, skin is your dog&#39;s largest organ - essential to everything from protecting her from bacteria and viruses to regulating her core temperature. So, Pedigree&#39;s added zinc and linoleic acid for a healthy coat and dermis.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>And oral care, often overlooked by pet owners, is the best protection against periodontal disease. Eighty percent of adult dogs will suffer from this painful condition; potentially worse, periodontal disease can lead to serious heart, lung, and kidney problems.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>As for healthy digestion and a strong immune system, those are no-brainers. Gastrointestinal troubles are no fun (for either of you), so <a href="tp://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;236874486;60003793;p;pc=[TPAS_ID]" target="_blank" title="Pedigree dog food">Pedigree&#39;s new formula</a> includes increased levels of fiber - essential for bacteria control, nutrient absorption, and even weight management. Vitamins C and E, antioxidants, were incorporated to boost immunity.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="tp://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;236874486;60003793;p;pc=[TPAS_ID]" target="_blank" title="Pedigree dog food">Pedigree&#39;s new line</a> hit stores last month, and the results of taste tests from our four-legged reviewers will be in shortly. Meanwhile, we applaud Pedigree&#39;s commitment to ensuring all dogs receive loving homes - and high-quality dog food.  If you would like to read more about Pedigree&#39;s new line, head on over the <a href="tp://ad.doubleclick.net/clk;236874486;60003793;p;pc=[TPAS_ID]" target="_blank" title="Pedigree pet food">Pedigree.com</a>.</p>

I am always in the market for things that will keep my dog occupied and <a href="http://www.bestbullysticks.com/home/bbs/page_8233_206/snooks_organic_sweet_potato_dog_chew.html" target="_blank">Snook&#39;s Organic Sweet Potato Dog Chew</a> does just that.  It is very long lasting, similar to what a rawhide bone would be, which, like I said, is a huge plus for me.  In addition, it is all-natural, organic, made in the U.S.A., recommended for dogs with allergies and sensitive stomachs, high in fiber and best of all, my dog LOVES them!</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>Being made from solely from sweet potatoes I was just a little bit worried that the chew would stain my carpet.&#0160; I held my breath and let my dog go to town on my very light colored carpet.&#0160; Rest assured that the treat did not leave so much as a mark!</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>I was curious as to what the other benefits to sweet potatoes were so I did some research.&#0160; I found that including all the listed above, sweet potatoes are an immune booster, they help to reduce inflammation which can be great for dogs with arthritis. They can help to ward off those cancer cells and assist in stabilizing blood sugars which can greatly help in the diabetic dog.</p>

<div>Those who know me know that I love to bake!&#0160; I am always seeking out new recipes to try and find it a huge bonus if I can find a healthy treat to bake for my family.&#0160; So, why not try to bake something healthy for my dog?&#0160; In my search to find a good dog treat recipe I came across <a href="http://www.mydoglovesem.com/" target="_blank">Custom Canine BisKITS</a>, healthy bake at home dog treat mixes.&#0160; They have pre-made mixes or you can choose to customize a mix, meaning you can pick the ingredients for the treats you bake for your dog. <br /></div>

<div style="float:right"><a href="http://www.mydoglovesem.com/" target="_blank" title="Polar eating his Ora&#39;s Favorite dog BisKIT"> <img alt="Ora_s_favorite_thumb" class="at-xid-6a010535222d03970c014e60f04679970c" height="202" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c014e60f04679970c-pi" style="margin-left: 5px;" title="Polar eating his Ora&#39;s Favorite dog BisKIT" width="272" /></a></div>
</div>
<div>The mixes come with freeze dried or air dried fruits, vegetables and meats.&#0160; All mixes are preservative free, sugar free, salt free and have no additives.&#0160; The instructions for these bake at home mixes could not be easier to follow AND you can re-use the bag the mixes come in to store the baked treats.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>About 20 minutes after I put these healthy treats in the oven the aroma was filling my house.&#0160; My kids kept asking me what I was making for dinner, I had to keep reminding them that we were baking treats for the dog!&#0160; And what did the dog think, you might be wondering?&#0160; My husband took him for a hike in the spring snow and when he returned, wet and cold, he was welcomed with a a few treats, still warm from the oven.&#0160; He was in heaven!&#0160; He gobbled them right up and then came and sat by me as if he was asking for more.<br /></div>

economics</a> and I gotta say you guys<br/>
are great to debate with so far.  Very rational, although not a lot of<br/>
support for your statements.  Many of you support your statements by pointing<br/>
me at libertarian doctrine.  That doesn&#8217;t support your argument, since it&#8217;s<br/>
just more rhetoric with the same opinion.  That&#8217;s like a Christian<br/>
handing me the bible as proof that the bible is true.</p>
<p>If you intend to email me about this post, please actually give supporting<br/>
arguments for what you claim.  I&#8217;ve done a good job of outlining a position<br/>
and explaining why I believe it&#8217;s more possibly true than your position.<br/>
Just stating what you think is true isn&#8217;t good enough.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#8217;d ask three questions of every libertarian:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If you disagreed with Greenspan&#8217;s policies, did you write your government representative<br/>
and the libertarian think tanks telling them this?</li>
	<li>If you disagree with how the government is run, then what are your offered <strong>actionable</strong> solutions?<br/>
Not abstract things like, &#8220;government should only enforce contracts&#8221;, but an actual real<br/>
change in a policy we have now.  Or, possibly just give me a policy or law you would want<br/>
removed, and what to replace it with.</li>
	<li>If you knew that libertarian think tanks were advising the government on financial policy,<br/>
and you knew that their version of your beliefs were wrong, then why did you continue supporting them?<br/>
Better yet, did you do anything to counter them as not true libertarians?</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, send me any blog post links you write so that I can round them up and continue<br/>
the debate.  I am genuinely interested in why so many people are still claiming to<br/>
be libertarians after the bailout and the financial collapse.</p>
<p>Finally, disagreement is not trolling.  If you read someone who begins their counter <br/>
argument to my post by claiming that I&#8217;m trolling, then you&#8217;re falling victim to a classic<br/>
online discourse tactic.  Keep your brain turned on and assume that they have a reason <br/>
to discredit the man, rather than what he&#8217;s saying.</p></div></content><updated>2009-01-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2009-01-09.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2009-01-08.html</id><title type='text'>2009-01-08</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><h2>The Two Flaws Of Libertarian Economics</h2>
<p><span class='caps'>UPDATE</span>:  See my <a href='/blog/2009-01-09.html'>most recent blog</a> post if you want to email me about this.  Thanks.</p>
<p>I like the <a href='http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2009/01/fundamental-problem-with-libertarianism.html'>anti-libertarianism stuff</a><br/>
Giles has going so I figured I&#8217;d write down<br/>
two things from real economics (not the crap they push) that they get wrong.</p>
<p>First off, the unstated goal of most libertarian doctrine is basically the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Corporations are more &#8220;efficient&#8221; than the government because of the<br/>
&#8220;natural selection&#8221; of our capitalist system.</li>
	<li>Corporations are therefore better than the government at everything.</li>
	<li>Corporations should be the government, or at least in control of it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, never mind the fact that nearly every corporation is completely<br/>
horribly inefficient and this recent 700 billion bailout, latest<br/>
recession, previous recessions, and the coming second great depression<br/>
proves that.  And let&#8217;s also forget the mountains of proof that shows<br/>
allowing corporations to control our government only leaves us with a<br/>
system that favors corporate greed over the consumer (which removes the<br/>
natural selection).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just talk about two basic principles of economics I learned in<br/>
business school.  Hopefully I get this right.</p>
<h2>Law</h2>
<p>In all capitalist economies, you require two things before you can<br/>
even start to have capitalism:</p>
<p>1) A strong rule of law.<br/>
2) A government that enforces that law consistently.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s before any kind of capitalist trade can happen.  Before money,<br/>
markets, stocks, corporations, anything.  But why?  Simply because<br/>
nobody will invest in something imaginary like a currency or a<br/>
corporation or even property if they think some random warlord or thug<br/>
will just take it from them.  They also won&#8217;t trust the existing<br/>
businesses if the government is not consistent in it&#8217;s application of the law.</p>
<p>Once you have this level playing field, you can then have an economy,<br/>
and it will operate relatively efficiently within the confines of how<br/>
the law system is structured.  Next almost always comes a free press,<br/>
market places, barter systems, currency, etc.  But, if you don&#8217;t have a<br/>
consistently enforced strong rule of law you don&#8217;t have jack shit.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s key here is notice I didn&#8217;t say a <strong>fair</strong> rule of law.  It doesn&#8217;t<br/>
matter if the law being enforced is draconian or not, it only needs to be<br/>
applied consistently and probably just to enough of the population that money<br/>
can flow.</p>
<p>Another way to put it is the government&#8217;s job is to enforce laws on<br/>
citizens and corporations so that &#8220;behaved&#8221; citizens don&#8217;t get screwed.</p>
<p>That is basically the first flaw of libertarianism:  If you shrink the<br/>
government down to nothing and have corporations in control then you<br/>
won&#8217;t have a rule of law.  And, no, &#8220;natural selection&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work<br/>
because if the businesses are in control of everything they can easily<br/>
change how things are selected.</p>
<p>You know, like getting a 700 billion dollar bailout and stopping all short<br/>
selling of their buddies&#8217; banks.</p>
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>That leads me to the second flaw of libertarian economics:  efficiency.</p>
<p>You see, libertarians look at the government and see that without<br/>
profit motive they have no incentive to operate &#8220;efficiently&#8221;.  They<br/>
then look at corporations and say, &#8220;Well these guys have to operate<br/>
efficiently because the market will naturally weed them out if they don&#8217;t.<br/>
Survival of the fittest!&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving aside the invalid comparison of an artificial social construct<br/>
like capitalism with a naturally occurring system like evolution, we have<br/>
a simple problem with their observation:  economists use the term<br/>
&#8220;efficiency&#8221; differently than programmers.</p>
<p>You see, most libertarians think of efficiency as &#8220;Fast! <span class='caps'>FAST</span> <span class='caps'>FAST</span> <span class='caps'>FAST</span>!&#8221;<br/>
They think it means lean and trim companies all working to gain the<br/>
maximum profit with the least effort necessary.  That&#8217;s how it works with<br/>
computers.  You pick the most &#8220;efficient&#8221; algorithm for the task and fret<br/>
and worry over how efficient every inch of your code is.</p>
<p>Yet, economics doesn&#8217;t use &#8220;efficiency&#8221; that way.  Here, take a look at <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(economics)'>the Wikipedia<br/>
page to get started.</a></p>
<p>Notice how there&#8217;s no mention of speed?  Notice also that there&#8217;s a<br/>
billion different theories for how to define efficiency?  That&#8217;s the<br/>
problem, in computer science there&#8217;s a very clear mathematical definition<br/>
for the term.  In economics it&#8217;s way more complicated and fuzzy.  Trying<br/>
to apply the computer science version of efficiency to economics is like<br/>
trying to apply multiplication to figure out who&#8217;s going to be the next<br/>
president.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the main definition given:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.</li>
	<li>More output cannot be obtained without increasing the amount of inputs.</li>
	<li>Production proceeds at the lowest possible per-unit cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the problem here?  In all the talk of efficiency by libertarians they<br/>
forget the fundamental thing you need to make all of this &#8220;efficiency&#8221;<br/>
work: Without a rule of law to enforce payment and fair trade,<br/>
you can&#8217;t even <strong>start</strong> to have things like &#8220;increasing the amount of<br/>
inputs&#8221;.</p>
<p>If one business can&#8217;t trust any other business, or even worse if<br/>
some businesses have an unfair advantage over others, then you get a<br/>
shutdown of the whole system.  Businesses stop offering other businesses<br/>
credit because they&#8217;re afraid they won&#8217;t get paid.  In manufacturing<br/>
credit is serious business, because you can&#8217;t get your materials needed to<br/>
produce your inventory without credit from your suppliers in the form of<br/>
delayed payment.  That&#8217;s why net-30 and net-60 payment schedules exist.<br/>
It&#8217;s basically credit.</p>
<p>Libertarians think that by putting corporations in charge they&#8217;ll increase<br/>
efficiency, but that&#8217;s by their narrow &#8220;faster!&#8221; definition.  The reality<br/>
is that they&#8217;ll increase monetary flow to certain chosen few corporations,<br/>
but that the rest of the economy will not trust them and trade will shut<br/>
down.</p>
<p>Alright, so you don&#8217;t believe me right?  I mean this sounds crazy since if<br/>
companies are in charge they&#8217;ll obviously do the right thing to keep<br/>
capital flowing.  Right?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s pull out a great example from the last two months:  The credit<br/>
crunch and the bailout.  First, the bailout is the result of a libertarian<br/>
wet dream where corporations gained control of the financial system and<br/>
made it &#8220;efficient&#8221;.  Greenspan and friends were all major libertarians,<br/>
and even Greenspan said he was full of shit.</p>
<p>What you are witnessing now is exactly what happens when we have a<br/>
&#8220;corporatist&#8221; (not capitalist) society the way libertarians would want.<br/>
Eventually, you get a situation where the few corporations that are in<br/>
control of the government gain power over the others and then the exchange<br/>
of capital becomes less efficient because of a lack of trust.</p>
<p>Remember how the bailout was supposed to open up lines of credit?  The 700<br/>
billion dollars was supposed to go to paying off bad assets so that banks<br/>
could start loaning money again.  This is essentially money that is used<br/>
to free up other money, kind of like monetary ex-lax.</p>
<p>The problem is, the second the initial (bigger better connected) banks <br/>
got their money they ran out and bought their competitors.  They didn&#8217;t<br/>
think strategically, they just bought anyone they could.  Once that<br/>
happened, all the other banks panicked and suddenly grabbed onto their<br/>
money and took whatever bailout cash they could to beef up their defenses<br/>
so they wouldn&#8217;t get bought.</p>
<p>Goodbye credit.</p>
<p>Remember when Ford, GM, and Chrysler showed up at Congress to beg for<br/>
money?  Why was Ford there if they were profitable and claimed they didn&#8217;t<br/>
need any money?  Well, they were worried that if GM or Chrysler got a<br/>
sudden influx of cash that GM or Chrysler would use it to just buy up Ford<br/>
at a fire sale price and take their profits.  They didn&#8217;t trust the<br/>
government to prevent that, so they went there to ask for money too.</p>
<p>This is <strong>exactly</strong> why the libertarian ideal of efficiency as speed doesn&#8217;t<br/>
work.  Money was very quickly given to corporations with no government<br/>
oversight.  Exactly how libertarians would want it.  This speed of funding<br/>
and removal of law allowed their greed to quickly consume them and put us<br/>
right back where we started.</p>
<p>Now, in a functioning economic system with a strong rule of law, the<br/>
government would have been kicking the shit out of the big banks and the<br/>
ratings agencies decades ago.  They would not have allowed them to get such<br/>
high debt/capital ratios.  They sure as hell wouldn&#8217;t have let them<br/>
function without being completely honest about their risk exposure.</p>
<p>In that situation (the non-libertarian truly capitalist way) the strong<br/>
government enforcing laws equally without a profit motive would have been<br/>
able to put a check on the insanity, or at least warned people about it<br/>
and consumers could have avoided it.</p>
<p>The end result of a libertarian doctrine is simply that we become a<br/>
fascist oligarchy controlled by rich white assholes who think that making<br/>
sure a kid gets a good education and food is a waste of money.</p>
<p>You know, the kids who will eventually go on to work in their companies.</p></div></content><updated>2009-01-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2009-01-08.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2009-01-07.html</id><title type='text'>2009-01-07</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Just a quick blog post saying that my video for my <span class='caps'>CUSEC</span> 2008<br/>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a great time insulting the stupid people on your site for a year.<br/>
It&#8217;s been a blast watching you dance like little puppets, posting nearly<br/>
every blog post I&#8217;ve written within minutes of me writing it.  Most of the<br/>
time, you guys post my blog entries and then say you hate them.  It<br/>
boggles the mind why you would post something you hate.</p>
<p>However, I have become tired of your entertainment.  Getting posted<br/>
consistently to your one-liner-bitch-fest is trivial.  It&#8217;s boring, and<br/>
your comments and commentary are boring.</p>
<p>Reddit, it&#8217;s over.  I won&#8217;t be writing anything else to insult you or your<br/>
small faction of vocal idiots.  Consider this my last post talking about<br/>
you.</p>
<p>Eagles don&#8217;t hunt flies, and your corpse is full of maggots.</p>
<h2>Dear Hacker News,</h2>
<p>Man, I like you guys.  Even when you guys hate me you have something<br/>
intelligent to say, and usually it&#8217;s pretty damn funny.  Love me or hate<br/>
me, you have been the stars of this show.  For every one-liner on reddit<br/>
there has always been ten well written paragraphs of meaningful opinion on<br/>
your site.  Your news feed is excellent, and HN is about the only site I<br/>
will actually visit when I&#8217;m bored and away from my feed reader.</p>
<p>Hacker News, I have a very nice Santa Day present for you:</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m not going to write anymore rants.</strong></p>
<p>I have become tired of Zed&#8217;s So Fucking Awesome.  It has lost its<br/>
entertainment value and impedes my more recent interests in music and<br/>
philosophy.</p>
<p>I of course will still make fun of people, and will entertain with my<br/>
humor, but I won&#8217;t write rants.  I may do some ranting songs, maybe a<br/>
podcast, but starting now I&#8217;m going to write intelligent thoughtful essays<br/>
and create musical art.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the great comments HN.  Don&#8217;t lose your soul.</p>
<h2>Dear Ruby,</h2>
<p>Aw, poor guy, I think spent an entire year kicking you in the nuts and<br/>
making you my bitch.  I just can&#8217;t tear into someone so weak anymore, and<br/>
the Rails+Merb marriage is a sign that you guys are desperate.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m not gonna pick on you anymore.  I&#8217;m gonna go focus on my own stuff<br/>
now and just leave you be.  You&#8217;ve had enough, and hopefully you&#8217;ve<br/>
learned your lesson to never underestimate a man like me again.  The next<br/>
guy you insult and piss on could be another Zed who comes and tears you<br/>
down with a single blog post.</p>
<p>And with that, my Ruby days are completely behind me.  I don&#8217;t really have<br/>
much association with Ruby anymore, with only a few old friends here and<br/>
there and some old software I don&#8217;t maintain much.  I was glad to have the<br/>
experience, even if it didn&#8217;t work out for me.  I was well known before<br/>
Ruby, and I&#8217;m more well known after Ruby.  For that I&#8217;m grateful.</p>
<p>Ruby, merry Santa Day, and good luck.</p>
<h2>Dear Fans,</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t fret, my blog and my personality aren&#8217;t going anywhere.  My plan is<br/>
to change up what I write to be my more intelligent essays and blog posts<br/>
on what I&#8217;m doing in software.  I also plan to create a music and sound<br/>
component of my blog that I will try to make entertaining, weird, and<br/>
funny.  People who like reading my technical and philosophical essays will<br/>
be able to read the blog, and people who like to hear my jokes can come to<br/>
the podcast and music.</p>
<p>Why the change?</p>
<p>Well, I started this incarnation of my blog almost exactly one year ago<br/>
because I was fed up with people not listening to me when I wrote<br/>
intelligent essays about interesting topics.  Instead, everyone listened<br/>
to the raving macho asswipes of the internet.</p>
<p>What you have witnessed is a year long proof that programmers will usually<br/>
only listen to the man who seems toughest, not the one who&#8217;s most possibly<br/>
right.</p>
<p>I remember when I realized that fact:  It was 1996 or there abouts, and I<br/>
saw a cover of some tech magazine with Grady Booch, Jim Rumbaugh, and Ivar<br/>
Jacobson on the cover.  They had their arms crossed and these stern looks<br/>
on their face that said, &#8220;I am a badass mother fucker and you better use<br/>
Object Oriented Programming bitches.&#8221;</p>
<p>I immediately thought, &#8220;Why are these guys so mad at me, and why do they<br/>
act like they&#8217;re so tough?&#8221;  It boggled my mind that programmers would get<br/>
all gangsta about <span class='caps'>OOP</span>.</p>
<p>The result of their stance was very clear:  Objects won and functions<br/>
lost.  The Lisp programmers were rational and intelligent (mostly), and<br/>
the C++ programmers were macho assholes who decreed irrational shit like,<br/>
&#8220;You should completely define your program before you write it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s depressing, but with so many men in programming, this trend of<br/>
listening to whoever talks like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Ditka'>Mike Ditka</a> with scowls and crossed<br/>
arms will most likely continue.  Programmers will listen to people like<br/>
James Gosling, Dave Thomas, <span class='caps'>DHH</span> and Dijkstra not because what they say is<br/>
all that intelligent or thoughtful, but because they say it like a Man&#8217;s<br/>
Man&#8482;.</p>
<p>After dealing with that crap for years, I decided it would be fun to<br/>
parody that kind of asshole and take it to the ultimate extreme.  I mean,<br/>
seriously, leather, neon strippers, and bleeding skulls?  Anyone who<br/>
thought that shit was serious is a total idiot.</p>
<p>Now I am bored with the theme.  It is too constricting on my current<br/>
interests and makes me feel like I can&#8217;t write anything intelligent or<br/>
thoughtful anymore.  No way I could post any serious music attempts or<br/>
anything remotely interesting.</p>
<p>Therefore, my dear fans, the Zed&#8217;s So Fucking Awesome persona will become<br/>
old news very soon.  I will have a new very fun idea going soon, and I<br/>
will focus on longer essays about intelligent topics.  I will entertain<br/>
you with weird and quirky music, funny songs, and maybe a podcast or two.</p>
<p>But, I will not write anymore rants.</p>
<p>Merry Santa Day!</p></div></content><updated>2008-12-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-12-25.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-12-24.html</id><title type='text'>2008-12-24</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><h2>Ruby Is So Nice</h2>
<p>Ruby people are so nice. Just like this nice chat overheard in #merb on<br/>
irc.freenode.org:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
[+pooswaa] im going to be the next zed, except not a douchebag faggot.
...
[+donri] haha zed. I wonder what he's thinking of the merge.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Gotta love the irony of some guy who&#8217;s nick is slang for<br/>
<a href='http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pooswa'>pussy</a> in French<br/>
calling me a douchebag faggot in the <strong>Mongrel+erb (merb)</strong> <span class='caps'>IRC</span> channel.<br/>
I&#8217;m sure pooswaa is a real tough guy too.  I&#8217;m not quite sure why he wants<br/>
to be like someone he thinks is a &#8220;faggot&#8221;, but maybe what he&#8217;s really<br/>
saying is he wants me inside him filling him with my love.  Too bad for<br/>
him, since I like vagina not mangina.</p>
<p>And, did you see how all those nice Ruby people told this guy to shut up<br/>
and be nice?  Way to <a href='http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/2008/10/striving-for-civility-in-the-ruby-and-rails-community.html'>demand politeness</a><br/>
from your fellow Ruby lusers.</p>
<p>However, the more important line of that chat is, &#8220;I wonder what [Zed&#8217;s] thinking of the [Merb+Rails] merge?&#8221;</p>
<h2>(Mongrel+Erb) == Rails?</h2>
<p>Fucking awesome.  I&#8217;m so glad that <span class='caps'>DHH</span> and friends were able to put away<br/>
their stupid competitive bullshit and realize they have the chance to make<br/>
something better.  Too bad it&#8217;s probably too late in the project to make<br/>
an impact, but it does give me some hope that Ruby people are actually<br/>
trying to be nicer.</p>
<p>Now, if they can just get Chad to quit trying to get people who call him<br/>
an asshole fired we&#8217;d be set.  Fucking passive aggressive loser weirdo.</p>
<p>Competitive people kind of weird me out.  I&#8217;m not so much of a competitive<br/>
guy, and I mostly try to live in a way that focuses less on how well I do<br/>
compared to other people, and more on how well I do compared to myself.<br/>
If you constantly compare yourself to others, then all you&#8217;ll ever be is<br/>
just as good as them, maybe a little better.  You&#8217;ll also miss out on all<br/>
the fantastic things you might actually be good at while you&#8217;re focused on<br/>
being better than them at what they&#8217;re good at.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the reasons guys like Chad, Dave, and Dave kind of give me<br/>
the creeps.  They are just ultra competitive in so many weird ways.<br/>
Anyone who seems to rise up to challenge them has to be crushed.  Which is<br/>
weird to me since they&#8217;re living in an open source world, so crushing your<br/>
competition doesn&#8217;t get you nearly as far as collaborating and striving<br/>
for internal excellence</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take Chad.  I mean seriously, why the fuck would Chad try to cheat<br/>
at a game of werewolf?  I mean, why the fuck bother playing a game of<br/>
werewolf in the first place, but to also cheat at something so utterly<br/>
retarded just boggles the mind.  If the point is to make new friends and<br/>
interact with people, then pissing on their dumbass 1800&#8217;s parlour game<br/>
isn&#8217;t going to do it.</p>
<p><span class='caps'>DHH</span> is also ultra-competitive like this, which really was a little bit of<br/>
a problem for me in the early days of Mongrel.  At one point he tried to<br/>
convince me to make Mongrel work only with Rails.  He just didn&#8217;t want<br/>
Og+Nitro to &#8220;win&#8221;.  Whatever the fuck that means.  Og+Nitro wasn&#8217;t any<br/>
better or worse than Rails, but it did have one thing Rails didn&#8217;t:</p>
<p><strong>A lot less fucking meta-programming.</strong></p>
<p>Back then, when you talked to old-school Ruby coders, they preferred<br/>
Og+Nitro because it used plain old <span class='caps'>OOP</span> to do most of the processing.<br/>
It ran faster, was simpler to understand, and just felt more like Ruby.<br/>
Rails felt like a totally different language.</p>
<p>Now, imagine if I had gone along with DHH&#8217;s request to take Mongrel and<br/>
make it Rails specific so that he could compete with Og+Nitro.  Well,<br/>
Mongrel wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as popular or useful, but I might have<br/>
got some sweet deal from 37signals and become <span class='caps'>BFF</span> with all of rails core<br/>
for sucking their tiny cocks.</p>
<p>Instead of doing what <span class='caps'>DHH</span> wanted I followed my principles.  I believe that<br/>
open source only works when people share and there&#8217;s contribution given<br/>
back for what you take.  If you don&#8217;t give back, then you get the <br/>
tragedy of the commons and people stop producing open source.  Making<br/>
Mongrel a Rails specific system would have excluded many Ruby web<br/>
frameworks and innovations that followed.</p>
<p>Now we see the results of that decision, and it makes me happy.  I didn&#8217;t<br/>
do the work, that&#8217;s totally on Ezra and the rest of the Merb team for<br/>
writing a better Rails.  They did such a good job that they were able to<br/>
get Merb to such a position that the notoriously competitive <span class='caps'>DHH</span> and<br/>
rails-core were willing to put aside their stupidity and actually work<br/>
with a competitor to make something better.</p>
<p>I honestly didn&#8217;t think that would ever happen.  I just assumed that Merb<br/>
would eventually wipe out Rails by being the better framework, or they&#8217;d<br/>
wipe each other out soon.</p>
<p>So, congrats are in order.  You guys are finally grown-ups and now have<br/>
the chance to make something better.</p>
<p>Hopefully they won&#8217;t fuck it up with their typical back room deals and<br/>
political spin bullshit.</p>
<h2>One Last Thing About My Haters</h2>
<p>Something I&#8217;ve noticed about the people who tell others I&#8217;m an asshole is<br/>
this:</p>
<p><strong>They&#8217;re biz dudes.</strong></p>
<p>Ya see, before I did my little rant business guys were out pitching VCs<br/>
their stupid little social networks with Rails.  It didn&#8217;t matter that<br/>
their idea was retarded, all they had to do was mention &#8220;Rails&#8221; and &#8220;10x<br/>
faster&#8221; and the VC dude would spooge all over his desk in a frenzy trying<br/>
to get their business.</p>
<p>Then I changed all that.  After my rant, the simple words &#8220;400 restarts<br/>
per day&#8221; could kill a Rails project dead.  Any time a dick cheese like<br/>
Michael Koziarski opened his fat fucking mouth people laughed at him.  If<br/>
someone pitched a Rails project, they had to actually have a good idea,<br/>
not just Rails.</p>
<p>On a whim, I started keeping tabs on people who wrote nasty shit about me<br/>
online.  I&#8217;d find some idiot on reddit mouthing off with his pathetic<br/>
one-liners, track him down (because he uses the same name on reddit as he<br/>
does on myspace), and then find out he&#8217;s a douchebag biz dude or a<br/>
wannabe.</p>
<p>It actually didn&#8217;t dawn on me that there was a connection, but then I<br/>
started hearing the same story from people who&#8217;d go interview at Rails<br/>
startups.  They would interview, ask what the company thought of me, and<br/>
then immediately the biz dudes would yell, &#8220;Oh that guy&#8217;s an asshole,<br/>
don&#8217;t listen to him!&#8221;</p>
<p>You see, the <span class='caps'>MBA</span> douchebag piece of shit needs Rails and the hype.  He<br/>
can&#8217;t explain what he wants to build, and he can&#8217;t build it, but if he&#8217;s<br/>
got enough hyped VC keywords in his pitch he can get lots of someone<br/>
else&#8217;s money.  Well, he used to be able to get it.</p>
<p>Yet, my rant fucked that up for him, so his only weapon is to discredit<br/>
me, even though he&#8217;s never really even met me, and he&#8217;ll end up using my<br/>
software that I gave him for free.  Neat trick eh?  But do you really want<br/>
to work for someone like that?  A money grubbing shit fuck who can&#8217;t<br/>
really do anything but talk about buzzwords like a drunk frat boy parrot?</p>
<p>Based on this, I have a suggestion:  The next time you interview for a<br/>
Rails position, ask the biz guy what he thinks about me.  If he says,<br/>
&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; then maybe it&#8217;s alright.  If he calls me an asshole, ask him<br/>
these two questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8220;Really?  Wow, did you ever meet him?&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;What did he do to you that makes him such an asshole?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>The way your <span class='caps'>MBA</span> pooswa answers those two questions will tell you more<br/>
about his pseudo-alpha male mind than anything else you could ask.  If<br/>
he&#8217;s a dick about it, or lies, or if he actually can&#8217;t say why I&#8217;m an<br/>
asshole, then I&#8217;d say move on or charge a bigger fee.</p>
<p>And now, back to my guitar!</p></div></content><updated>2008-12-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-12-24.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-12-16.html</id><title type='text'>2008-12-16</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>My RubyFringe presentation is available online at InfoQ:</p>

we can do with them using technology.  When it came to sound, we had to sit through this<br/>
excruciating series of videos of nerds trying to rock out with wands, sticks, balls, helmets,<br/>
pretty much anything that wasn&#8217;t an instrument.  Every video demonstrated a horribly dressed geek<br/>
waving his little thing around at random with no rhythmic sense making noise.  It was awful,<br/>
and when it was over I said, &#8220;You know, the problem with all of that music is you just can&#8217;t<br/>
dance to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh man, did that get the geek&#8217;s panties in a bunch.  Dance?  Intelligent<br/>
people don&#8217;t <strong>dance</strong>.  We listen to classical things like the Waltz, or<br/>
the Tango, or &#8230;</p>
<p>These last few months I&#8217;ve been studying guitar full-time, and have an<br/>
idea for a slightly weird music project that needs a good sound<br/>
programming language.  I was inspired by <a href='http://books.google.com/books?id=tlDI6s4R84IC&amp;dq=The+Idea+Of+Absolute+Music&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kaY_QZeZrz&amp;sig=o-Lgxde9Kasd2TAHd0oF1D3Wh4Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result'>The Idea Of Absolute Music</a><br/>
to create something that is as completely the inverse of absolute music as<br/>
possible.  To pull that off, I needed a programming language that was<br/>
great for doing sound.</p>
<h2>Yes, Your Language Sucks At Sound</h2>
<p><a href='http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/'>ChucK</a> however is good for sound because it<br/>
understands the one key element that makes music what it is:  rhythm.  They<br/>
call it &#8220;strongly timed&#8221; but it&#8217;s really just good rhythm.  The ability to<br/>
say that certain things happen at certain time intervals and to coordinate<br/>
many things at once on those intervals.</p>
<p>You see, without rhythm, your ear can&#8217;t really tell one string of notes from<br/>
another within a melody, and without rhythm harmony sounds &#8220;weird&#8221;.  Sure there&#8217;s<br/>
some musicians who aren&#8217;t slaves to rhythm, but those are special cases and maybe<br/>
in 2000 years the general population will enjoy that music.  But, as long as humans<br/>
like to dance and fuck we&#8217;ll need rhythm in our music.  Just get over it.</p>
<p>ChucK however gets this, and its concurrency model directly supports it.<br/>
Other languages don&#8217;t really think about time in their concurrency other<br/>
than to say it must be &#8220;<span class='caps'>FAST</span>!&#8221;.  ChucK allows you to coordinate &#8220;shreds&#8221;<br/>
through use of timing and events in a way that makes things pretty darn<br/>
easy to code up cooperating threads (ehem &#8220;shreds&#8221;) of activity.  Their<br/>
examples are damn persuasive when it comes to generating and analyzing<br/>
sound.</p>
<p>ChucK is so good at this that if you want to take three scripts and make<br/>
them run concurrently together, you just do:</p>
chuck script1.ck script2.ck script3.ck
<p>and ChucK will magically run those as their own shreds.  It&#8217;s pretty fun<br/>
to just take a bunch of random noise makers and run them all at once to<br/>
see what you get.</p>
<p>About the only that I don&#8217;t like about ChucK so far is the bugs and half-done nature of things,<br/>
but it is experimental, and so far the code isn&#8217;t too bad.  I mean it&#8217;s not great, but<br/>
it&#8217;s not Ruby&#8217;s C implementation at least.</p>
<h2>So I Put A Physics Engine In It</h2>
<p>In order to implement my idea, I needed a language like ChucK, but with a Physics<br/>
engine.  I need to ability to put sounds into a sound scape and then have an <br/>
engine move them around, while it adjusted the pitch, gain, and pan of the sound<br/>
sources to simulate movement.  This isn&#8217;t anything new, but what is new is having it<br/>
readily available in a language that makes it all so easy.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the code for <a href='http://rafb.net/p/SRbR9A13.html'>my first cut at how it would work</a><br/>
to create an observer that moves away from a sound source.  In this code, I setup an<br/>
observer, then throw in a wall that makes a noise.  Then I have this observer robot<br/>
walk up to the beeping wall and away from it.  In my hacked up ChucK source tree this<br/>
then adjusts the gain with a simple sqrtf(1.0 / distance) formula.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ll notice is this first line:</p>
SinOsc s =&gt; Physics c =&gt; dac;
<p>That takes a sine wave oscillator, patches it into my Physics engine, and<br/>
then that goes out to the dac (digital audio converter).   The sounds<br/>
played through the SinOsc are then altered by the Physics engine depending<br/>
on where the observer is in relation to the first body.  The eventual goal<br/>
is to be able to wire up as many of these as you like and have their gains<br/>
all adjusted concurrently, but right now I got one working.</p>
<p>The result is when you listen this script the beeping comes toward you,<br/>
then walks away, then comes back, and reasonably realistically given the<br/>
time I spent on it.  Since ChucK doesn&#8217;t have a lot of documentation on<br/>
the internals I had to scrape around to figure out how to do the gain, but<br/>
I think the remaining parameters are now within grasp.</p>
<p>What I plan on doing next is changing out the physics engine and<br/>
implementing the other necessary features to make this work.  I used the<br/>
<a href='http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Box2D_Lite'>Box2d_Lite</a> source<br/>
since it was simple and I could compile it into ChucK&#8217;s VM easily.  I want<br/>
to look at either the full Box2D or <a href='http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk'>Chipmunk Physics</a> instead.</p>
<p>The other thing is I need to find better reference material for how to do<br/>
the doppler effect, and relative pan and gain for the sounds.</p>
<p>Otherwise, just the code I have now should work for my little music<br/>
project so when I&#8217;m done I&#8217;ll post it up for people to play with.</p></div></content><updated>2008-12-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-12-15.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-12-06.html</id><title type='text'>2008-12-06</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p><a href='/projects/sos/'>Son of Sam</a> is coming along nicely.  It now supports the<br/>
following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An entirely Python based email solution.  No sendmail, postfix, m4, aliases files, etc.</li>
	<li>But, sendmail and postfix are still way better at huge scale bulk, so it relays to them.</li>
	<li>Uses <a href='http://www.sqlalchemy.org/'>SQLAlchemy</a> to do real data models for your application.</li>
	<li>Has actual <a href='http://www.makotemplates.org/'>Mako</a> templates for handling replies and constructing emails.</li>
	<li>Uses a routing system to match email addresses and then have handlers process them.</li>
	<li>Has a typical handler processing system where classes do the work, just like in a web app.</li>
	<li>Includes a nice Finite State Machine processing system for conversation management.</li>
	<li>Incredibly small so far given all the stuff it does.  Currently at about 500 lines of python.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is working now, in various states of quality, and there&#8217;s more to come as I use<br/>
SoS to build out a simple mailing list system and maybe a couple other sample applications.</p>
<p>You can see a temporary <a href='http://pastie.org/332544'>Pastie with a sample application skeleton</a><br/>

server.  I mentioned it once before months ago, but SoS is a simple <br/>
yet very powerful <span class='caps'>SMTP</span> server written in Python.  It basically lets you<br/>
write an email application the way you would write a modern web application.<br/>
Instead of stupid milter or pipes off of aliases in some weirdo M4 macro<br/>
config file, you create actual application code in nicely organized<br/>
source files.</p>
<p>How SoS works is it uses the Python asyncore and smtpd libraries to receive<br/>
email and process it, then it treats them the same way a web application<br/>
framework would: as a request.  You then have a set of handlers that process<br/>
the message based on routings, and your handlers can then:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hook into databases using <a href='http://www.sqlalchemy.org/'>SQLAlchemy</a> (or anything).</li>
	<li>Modify the message, drop it, <span class='caps'>SPAM</span> filter it, greylist, etc.</li>
	<li>Forward it on to a relay host.</li>
	<li>Send other emails in response.</li>
	<li>Track complex conversations involving multiple emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>SoS also uses a simple little Finite State Machine library I wrote to keep <br/>
track of what&#8217;s going on.  Since <span class='caps'>SMTP</span> doesn&#8217;t have the concept of a<br/>
a request with data like <span class='caps'>HTTP</span> does, you need a way to track a conversation<br/>
process.  Using an <span class='caps'>FSM</span>, each email received causes steps in the <span class='caps'>FSM</span> to<br/>
transition, so you can process the conversation accurately.  SoS does a<br/>
simple pickle of the <span class='caps'>FSM</span> for each handler and you just do your thing<br/>
inside that.</p>
<p>What I did this weekend was start a fun little side project (more on that<br/>
later) and then I managed to connect it to<br/>
<a href='http://webpy.org/'>web.py</a> and made them share the same SQLAlchemy model.<br/>
I then have the email application own the data model, and the web front-end<br/>
simply lives off that.</p>
<p>If you wanna play with the code, feel free to check out the <a href='http://bazaar-vcs.org/'>Bazaar</a><br/>
repository by doing:</p>
bzr branch http://zedshaw.com/repository/sos
<p>Then you can take a look at the code.  Installing it will probably be a pain in <br/>
the ass, but email me if you&#8217;re interested in trying it.  I probably need to<br/>
work through a few people doing an install to get the instructions right.</p>
<p>The thing to check out is the <strong>sample</strong> directory in the source tree.  That shows<br/>
you how the <span class='caps'>FSM</span> works and how an application is laid out.</p></div></content><updated>2008-11-23T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-11-23.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-11-21.html</id><title type='text'>2008-11-21</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I love <a href='http://hackety.org/'>Why The Lucky Stiff&#8482;</a> and his crazy<br/>
creative ways.  His latest <a href='http://hackety.org/2008/11/21/aCostlyParade.html'>post about me</a><br/>
and how nice The Ruby Community really is gave me chills.  The great _why<br/>
is actually mentioning me!  I mean, sure he&#8217;s dissing me without really dissing<br/>
me so that he can be an asshole while still being nice, but I got a mention<br/>
on his blog!</p>
<p>I remember when I first saw _why play with his Thirsty Cups.  That was way<br/>
back before he got tired of the Nice Ruby Community becoming too commercial<br/>
so he didn&#8217;t want to come to RubyConf anymore.  I think they had to kidnap him<br/>
to get him to perform at that RailsConf too.  After that, he told all of his<br/>
super Nice Ruby Community friends that he&#8217;s going to do <a href='http://hacketyhack.net/'>Hackety Hack</a><br/>
instead of hang with them.  He even made his own special version of the<br/>
Ruby interpreter to make Shoes work.</p>
<p>It was a sad day for me, because really the only reason I hung out in Ruby<br/>
was because of _why.  Mr. Why actually blessed me with his presence during<br/>
one of my hacking sessions and made me feel smarter by association.  I<br/>
showed him Ragel (which he used to write Hpricot), and showed him some vim<br/>
tricks, and he talked to Obie.  It was great just having him warming the<br/>
air near me.</p>
<p>In contrast to _why, other Nice Ruby People didn&#8217;t seem so nice.  Austin<br/>
Ziegler once called me an asshole to my face in front of a bunch of people.<br/>
Ryan Davis said I act like a pussy online, and then tried to threaten me<br/>
physically on a cold New York street.  Ara T. Howard spent a lot of time<br/>
telling people I didn&#8217;t know shit about systems (when I found the memory<br/>
leak he thought was part of the system).  Dave Thomas actually<br/>
devoted an entire 20 seconds of his key note <strong>just</strong> to insult my work on<br/>
Mongrel.  Kevin Clark repeatedly called me names without anyone saying anything<br/>
to him, because &#8220;fuck you <span class='caps'>FUCK</span> <span class='caps'>YOU</span>&#8221; is obviously nice.</p>
<p>But _why was nice all around.  I mean sure, there was that spat with<br/>
Hpricot and Nokogiri over who had the fastest <span class='caps'>HTML</span> parser on the planet.<br/>
And sure he just wrote a weirdly passive aggressive blog post mentioning me<br/>
that tells people not to feed the trolls (which oddly feeds the trolls).<br/>
And he insulted a <a href='/blog/2008-10-30.html'>heartfelt blog post I wrote</a> to get<br/>
people to find help when they&#8217;re in trouble by going to a church.  And yeah<br/>
I never said one bad thing about him (because honestly, I really do want<br/>
to be him when I grow up).</p>
<p>Other than all that he&#8217;s the real Jesus in this.  The true saint.  The one<br/>
to get the Nice Ruby People back on track to taking that wonderfully stable<br/>
Ruby interpreter his friend Matz wrote to the edges of all that is possible<br/>
in computing.  Well, probably just the edges of what hundreds of thousands<br/>
of lines of C pre-processor code can do, but that&#8217;s still pretty far in<br/>
most circles.</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for guys like _why holding down the real Nice Ruby Community<br/>
spirit, I don&#8217;t know where they&#8217;d be.  I mean _why&#8217;s work is so successful<br/>
without being commercial, and yet is so similar to so many commercial<br/>
applications that other people have written already.  People read his code<br/>
to find out all the great meta programming tricks they need to make their<br/>
software wonderfully readable.  His book on Ruby is a classic training tool<br/>
that makes excellent Meta Programmers out of everyone.</p>
<h2>The Truth About Trolls</h2>
<p>You mean, people couldn&#8217;t figure out I was a fucking troll?  How fucking<br/>
stupid do you have to be when my fucking blog is called &#8220;Zed&#8217;s So Fucking<br/>
Awesome&#8221;?  It was entirely my intention that dickwads in the Ruby Old Guard<br/>
would would leave me the fuck alone.  Either because of fear that I had<br/>
dirt on them, or fear that I could influence people with my writing.</p>
<p>Seriously, go back and look at all the times I&#8217;ve taken the Ruby Old Guard<br/>
to task for something stupid.  You notice a trend?  I don&#8217;t strike first.<br/>
Every time I say something about them, it&#8217;s in response to something stupid<br/>
they&#8217;ve written that&#8217;s just too juicy to not destroy.  With a community<br/>
so hypocritical it&#8217;s just so easy to tear them apart when they make stupid<br/>
claims.</p>
<p>Take <a href='http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/31-myth-2-rails-is-expected-to-crash-400-timesday'>DHH&#8217;s Rails Myth #2</a> <br/>
as the perfect example of how to be a passive aggressive asswipe.  If you<br/>
have half a brain, you&#8217;ll read that post and see all the underhanded insults<br/>
and insinuations about my mental health masked with an air of concern.  <span class='caps'>DHH</span><br/>
even emailed me claiming this little myth was written in the nicest possible<br/>
way.</p>
<p>If <span class='caps'>DHH</span> were an actually positive nice person, he would have written this one<br/>
myth very differently.  Instead of focusing on the past and on me, he would<br/>
have just said two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the past, Rails crashed, that is true.  I should have been honest with everyone.</li>
	<li>Now, however, thanks to the work of many people, Rails does not crash, and we&#8217;re constantly<br/>
working to keep it that way.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s all you have to write.  No mentioning of mental states, no invoking<br/>
the Troll.  Just admit your fault, and talk about how things are different.</p>
<p>But, doing that would mean that <span class='caps'>DHH</span> and rails core would have to admit that<br/>
they hoodwinked everyone.  When I talk about the 400 restarts/day admission,<br/>
I <strong>am not</strong> talking about the stability of Ruby <strong>now</strong>, I&#8217;m talking about<br/>
how <span class='caps'>DHH</span> lied to everyone about Ruby&#8217;s stability then.</p>
<p>Again, nice people don&#8217;t fucking lie to millions of people who believe in<br/>
them.</p>
<p>The truth about trolls is that many times, they are just pointing out what the<br/>
community doesn&#8217;t want to see.  When the dust settles, and most people have<br/>
left for something else, they can always look back and see large kernels of<br/>
truth in what the trolls said.  I&#8217;ve seen it with C, C++, Java, and now Ruby.</p>
<p>Which is sad, because ignoring the trolls is really what kills a community<br/>
off.</p></div></content><updated>2008-11-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-11-21.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-11-13.html</id><title type='text'>2008-11-13</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Well, <span class='caps'>DHH</span> seems to be caught in a lie in his latest<br/>
<a href='http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/29-the-rails-myths'>blog post on Rails<br/>
myths</a> so I feel I<br/>
should correct it.  An outright lie that <strong>Mongrel</strong> caused<br/>
his 400 restarts/day problem.  However, David must have forgotten<br/>
that I have a full log of the chat where he admitted it, so<br/>
let&#8217;s get into some nice clean truth for a change.</p>
<p>Normally I wouldn&#8217;t give a shit.  Ruby on Rails is so far<br/>
from my world right now that I don&#8217;t even really care.  I<br/>
play guitar and write with maybe some coding to pay the <br/>
bills and that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>However, I get really sick and tired of the passive aggressive<br/>
people who run things over at the Rails/Ruby Revolutionary Faction.<br/>
They have to project this image of being nice, but at the <br/>
same time are competitive jerks who try to destroy their enemies.<br/>
That&#8217;s why they constantly pick on little guys like Giles, Obie,<br/>
and myself, but never in a direct way.  It&#8217;s always with little<br/>
turns of the phrase, or rumors, or power plays behind closed doors.</p>
<p>The insults are always minor things you&#8217;d be crazy to get mad about, but<br/>
they still get under your skin.  It took a year of being called an idiot<br/>
by the same people who used my wares constantly before I finally gave up.</p>
<h2>Now It&#8217;s Mongrel</h2>
<p><span class='caps'>DHH</span> is right, in this <a href='http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/30-myth-1-rails-is-hard-to-deploy'>part of his<br/>
post</a><br/>
that <a href='http://www.modrails.com/'>Phusion Passenger</a> is the shit.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t using Phusion Passenger to deploy <strong>all</strong> of your Ruby web applications<br/>
(not just Rails) then you&#8217;re a dumbfuck.</p>
<p>Of course, I was saying that Phusion was great <a href='/blog/2008-06-13.html'>months ago</a> when I met them.<br/>
Again, <span class='caps'>DHH</span> and crew are late to the party, but that&#8217;s how they roll.  I<br/>
bet they were even bashing it at first in their little chat room.  Now<br/>
they&#8217;re backing it as the way to go, probably for no other reason<br/>
than to take Mongrel out as a competitor.</p>
<p>However, remember I told you that guys like <span class='caps'>DHH</span> never do anything<br/>
directly.  He praises Phusion Passenger saying it&#8217;s great and<br/>
better than Mongrel (for deployment).</p>
<p>Then, he tells a wild ass yet subtle lie about the <a href='http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/31-myth-2-rails-is-expected-to-crash-400-timesday'>400<br/>
restarts/day</a><br/>
being a <strong>Mongrel</strong> problem.  Let&#8217;s take a look at the magician<br/>
at work:</p>
&#8220;Zed insinuated that it&#8217;s normal for Rails to restart 400 times/day
because Basecamp at one point did this with a memory watcher that would
bounce its Mongrels when they hit, I believe, 250MB.&quot;
<p>If you simply remove &#8220;Mongrel&#8221; and replace it with &#8220;<span class='caps'>FCGI</span>&#8221; you have<br/>
the real truth.  <span class='caps'>DHH</span> was actually talking about <strong>FastCGI</strong> when<br/>
he said they had to restart, and that&#8217;s proven by the fact that <br/>
he hadn&#8217;t moved Basecamp to Mongrel yet, and was talking about<br/>
installing mentalguy&#8217;s fastthread library into his existing <br/>
FastCGI setup.</p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s have <span class='caps'>DHH</span> tell you instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
(15:10:24) DHH: btw, fastthread has definitely helped us
(15:10:29) Zed S.: that mongrel_service is great stuff
(15:10:30) DHH: we're running it on BC now
(15:10:33) Zed S.: oh?
(15:10:43) Zed S.: very nice.  what's the big improvement you noticed with fastthread?
(15:10:47) DHH: it hasn't completely removed our leaking issues, but drastically reduced them
(15:11:04) DHH: we have a cap at 160M where processes get restarted
(15:11:12) DHH: before fastthread we had ~400 restarts/day
(15:11:22) DHH: now we have perhaps 10
(15:11:29) Zed S.: oh nice
(15:11:33) Zed S.: and that's still fastcgi right?
(15:12:05) DHH: ye
(15:12:13) DHH: we're still not mongrel on the big apps
(15:12:18) DHH: but on all the small ones we are
 </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>See that? It&#8217;s the exact same chat I got my quote from in <a href='/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>The Rails Is A<br/>
Ghetto rant</a> but let&#8217;s emphasize the<br/>
important statement:</p>
(15:12:13) <span class='caps'>DHH</span>: we&#8217;re still not mongrel on the big apps
<p>Now, when you read his blog post he makes it seem like he had 400<br/>
restarts/day using Mongrel, yet right here he admits to using fastcgi and<br/>
having the restart problems.  It was fastthread that fixed up the<br/>
problems, which really points out just how broken Ruby is still.</p>
<p>To summarize the facts:</p>
<ul>
	<li><span class='caps'>DHH</span> was using FastCGI from the beginning of Basecamp and Rails.</li>
	<li>He had to do forced restarts 400 times a day because of leaking issues<br/>
under FastCGI (really Ruby).</li>
	<li>It wasn&#8217;t until Mongrel and later fastthread that people could<br/>
actually deploy without problems&#8230;almost <strong>2 years</strong> after Rails<br/>
was widely being adopted.</li>
	<li>This means that <span class='caps'>DHH</span> and all of rails-core lied to everyone <br/>
about Rails&#8217; stability for years, and keep lying.</li>
	<li>It also means that if you had problems with FastCGI, then you<br/>
were not crazy.  Ruby really was too unstable for production use.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was the point of telling people Rails crashed that much<br/>
back then.  It is of course better now, but only because of <br/>
the hard work of people like mentalguy and myself.  Everyone<br/>
else just denied there was a problem, including <span class='caps'>DHH</span>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also an indicator of just how fucked up Ruby really is.<br/>
I consider the <a href='http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/the_big_ruby_vulnerabilities.html'>Apple Patches</a><br/>
Ruby&#8217;s economic meltdown.  If the mishandling of that doesn&#8217;t<br/>
make you pause before picking Ruby then I don&#8217;t know what the<br/>
fuck would.  Shit like that could kill a company off overnight.</p>
<p>Anyway, if <span class='caps'>DHH</span> ever wonders why I flipped out, it&#8217;s this kind of <br/>
weird passive aggressive lying that did it.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Fuck Over Phusion Passenger</h2>
<p>The one thing that pissed me off about the Mongrel project was<br/>
how it destroyed my career path.  I don&#8217;t really think I ever<br/>
fully recovered from it, but Mongrel basically made it impossible<br/>
for me to get a regular job just doing my thing.  To have everyone<br/>
in your world using your software, but not offering you any jobs<br/>
greater than a system administrator position is tough.</p>
<p>My buddies over at Phusion are potentially in the same boat.  They did a<br/>
really good job marketing Passenger and their very nice patches to the<br/>
Ruby system named &#8220;Ruby Enterprise Edition&#8221;.  They <strong>could</strong> make some money<br/>
in this area where I couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Yet, I see them getting the same treatment I did when it comes<br/>
to the people who use their stuff.  All they are looking for<br/>
is support contracts and custom work, yet their stuff is so<br/>
good nobody needs them.  Rather than feed the ecosystem and just<br/>
buy their support licenses to support them, people who use<br/>
Phusion are probably just gonna take it and not give back.</p>
<p>If you actually do use Phusion, consider buying something from<br/>
the guys who made it.  It&#8217;s an awesome product, and if you <br/>
want them to continue developing it and giving it out for <br/>
free then give them money.</p>
<p>It just makes you a good open source citizen.</p></div></content><updated>2008-11-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-11-13.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-11-11.html</id><title type='text'>2008-11-11</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I&#8217;m quickly coming to the end of my first semester in music school<br/>
and am considering taking a consulting gig for the two month <br/>
break we have.  Not really sure what&#8217;s available these days, as<br/>
I actually haven&#8217;t touched a computer for the entire semester.</p>
<p>First off, I learned a ton so far and have improved my technique so<br/>
much, but I&#8217;m still way behind in what I need to know for the next<br/>
semester.  I&#8217;ll be spending any spare time I have studying guitar,<br/>
piano, and voice so I can roll into the next semester ready to go.</p>
<p>That means at least 3 hours a week of private lessons and about <br/>
four hours a day of practice, which isn&#8217;t hard.  These days I<br/>
get up at 6am to practice anyway so I&#8217;ll just continue that.</p>
<p>Now I have a choice:  I can continue living poor for the next<br/>
two months and just do nothing but music, or I can try to get<br/>
a job to make the rest of the year easier.</p>
<p>In order to figure out this dilemma, I&#8217;m curious if anyone <br/>
has offers for a two month gig.  If there&#8217;s something good<br/>
then I&#8217;ll do a job.  If not, then I&#8217;ll continue to study.</p>
<p>If you have a job you think I might find interesting, then<br/>
contact me.  If you have a job that&#8217;s totally mindless and <br/>
pays alright with flexible hours, then definitely contact me.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to being a starving artist!</p></div></content><updated>2008-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-11-11.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-10-30.html</id><title type='text'>2008-10-30</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>In this world there are these weird little dickheads who<br/>
think that they have some kind of magical powers manipulating others<br/>
to do their bidding.  They spend their days making people around them<br/>
dance like marionettes in a sick little play that only they find<br/>
funny.  The sad truth about manipulators is their machinations are only<br/>
powerful and effective in their own mind.</p>
<p>If you read my <a href='http://zedshaw.com/blog/2008-10-28.html'>previous blog post about Matthew Kaufman</a><br/>
it may have sounded like Matt was in trouble.  He was threatened and<br/>
thrown out of his apartment by some big evil bad man.  Matt promptly <br/>
disappeared and potentially could have been hurt.  He was a ghost who<br/>
simply left a bizarre panic ridden voice mail for me.</p>
<p>At the time I debated even doing anything.  This Matt character could <br/>
need help, or he could just be a manipulator trying to use me<br/>
as some kind of blunt weapon against his enemy.  This is why I took<br/>
my time trying to help the guy.  I had the feeling he was playing <br/>
a game, but after debating it and gathering the evidence I decided<br/>
to try and help.</p>
<p>You see, if I did nothing, there was a chance that Matthew could<br/>
have been dead.  If he had died and I could have helped him then<br/>
I would have hated myself.</p>
<p>Today however, someone who read my blog post finally got access<br/>
to his twitter feeds and sent me this tweet from him:</p>
All that we need to make us happy is
something to be enthusiastic about. :)! (today)
<p>That means he&#8217;s alive, probably doing well, and <strong>is now on my fucking<br/>
shit list.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m more than willing to help out a total stranger who needs my help,<br/>
so long as it doesn&#8217;t involve me handing them money or risking my life.<br/>
Hell, I&#8217;ve stopped fights between random people many times, putting<br/>
my self at risk.  I&#8217;ve pulled battered women out of abusive relationships.<br/>
Helped kids who were being beaten by bullies.  I got no problem stepping<br/>
up and protecting the weaker ones in our world.</p>
<p>When someone takes advantage of this by trying to manipulate me they<br/>
are seriously fucking with the wrong guy.  Here&#8217;s a tweet from Matt<br/>
on the 25th:</p>
yes, zed shaw, &#8230; <strong><span class='caps'>EVIDENCE</span> <span class='caps'>AND</span> <span class='caps'>OBSERVATION</span></strong> &#8230; not 20 year
old defined logic and reason <strong>12:35 PM Oct 25th</strong>
<p>That&#8217;s when this dick fucker gave me the call.  His crazy ass probably<br/>
read some fucking essay of mine and concocted this wild pussy ass passive<br/>
aggressive scheme to get back at his arch nemesis Michael.  Matt <br/>
probably sat in a big chair with a high back and black leather<br/>
stroking his feminine fucking fingers together saying, &#8220;Yes, yes,<br/>
dance my minions.  Dance!&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew there was a good chance he was fucking with me, but I had<br/>
no way to find out unless someone who knew him had evidence he was<br/>
alright.  A good long series of fairly happy tweets over the last<br/>
few days says he&#8217;s doing just fine.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t need my help at all, what he needs is a severe ass<br/>
kicking.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my favorite thing about manipulators:</p>
All passive aggressive manipulators are pussies.
<p>Anytime you meet that guy who thinks he&#8217;s some fucking criminal<br/>
mastermind who manipulates you into doing his bidding, just remember<br/>
that.  One good punch in the fucking nose and he&#8217;ll realize that <br/>
he actually doesn&#8217;t have control over anyone.</p>
<p>In Matt&#8217;s case, I better find an apology in my fucking email queue or a<br/>
very nice voice mail.  It is seriously uncool to make people think<br/>
you are hurt when you are <strong>not</strong>.</p>
<p>And, I&#8217;m still not the A-Team.</p>
<h2>More Reasons Why Reddit Blows</h2>
<p>If you just take this story on <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=347027'>Hacker News</a><br/>
vs the same <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/79z47/help_zed_get_in_contact_with_matt/'>On Reddit</a><br/>
you&#8217;ll start to realize why Reddit is a total joke.  I don&#8217;t even bother<br/>
reading Reddit, and usually just wait until a friend sends me a link to<br/>
something stupid redditors are saying.  In this case, you can clearly see<br/>
that the folks who participate in Hacker News are worth listening to:</p>
I hope this has a happy ending. &#8212; qwph
<p>The majority of the comments are well thought out, longer than just a<br/>
single sentence, and either debate the topic or try to help.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have the whore&#8217;s cunt known as reddit:</p>
Zed&#8217;s dead, baby. &#8212; Canadian_Infidel
<p>The majority of the comments are one-liners with stupid fucking jokes<br/>
about the A-Team and me being the Z-Team.  Oh, hahahahaha, such comic<br/>
fucking genius.  No, they don&#8217;t even try to mask their collective<br/>
stupidity and instead just skip right over the fact that someone needed to<br/>
be found and into unoriginal middle school quality gag humor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before, but all those morons do is provide entertainment<br/>
for the smarter people in the room.  Their stupid one-liner &#8220;commentary&#8221;<br/>
is not a part of the conversation.  It&#8217;s not social media.  All it<br/>
amounts to is the maximum their dipshit little <span class='caps'>ADD</span> infested brains<br/>
can handle in focus.</p>
<p>Their one-line comments are insignificant when compared<br/>
with the real conversation happening amongst the one-percenters out there.</p>
<p><span class='caps'>BTW</span>, reddit-whores, in <span class='caps'>NYC</span> if you call 311 to ask for anything related<br/>
to the police they transfer you to 911.  911 is basically the NYPD&#8217;s<br/>
main contact, and is <strong>designed</strong> to take insane amounts of calls and route<br/>
them fast and efficient.  Unlike your podunk little shit-hole town<br/>
where the whole emergency system can be knocked out by two crank callers<br/>
and a homeless guy pissing on the building.</p></div></content><updated>2008-10-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-10-30.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-10-28.html</id><title type='text'>2008-10-28</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p><span class='caps'>UPDATE</span>:  <a href='http://zedshaw.com/blog/2008-10-30.html'>Read my follow-up post</a> to this where I explain Matt is alright.</p>
<p>I was checking my voice mail Monday and clearing out anything I&#8217;d missed<br/>
when I heard a strange message from some random guy I&#8217;d never met.  I&#8217;m<br/>
hoping it&#8217;s nothing, but read this story, and if you know the people<br/>
involved, then please let me know what you know.</p>
<p>In the voice mail Matt sounds very distraught.  He rambles on, forgets<br/>
what he was saying, misses important details, and seems to be completely<br/>
confused.  I think I could hear him walking outside somewhere.  He says<br/>
that he knows me from using Mongrel, and that he thinks I might be able to<br/>
help him tell people what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Then he says that he&#8217;s been forced out of his apartment on 31st by one<br/>
Michael Brauser and that he&#8217;s received death threats.  I&#8217;m not clear on<br/>
whether Matt claims the threats were from Michael Brauser or not, <strong>and in<br/>
no way am I accusing Michael Brauser of any wrongdoing</strong>.  I&#8217;m simply<br/>
trying to figure out what might have happened and make sure Matt&#8217;s <br/>
alright.</p>
<p>Even when Matt mentions Michael he loses track of his topic, and<br/>
forgets where Michael works.  He then rambles some more, and hangs up<br/>
after apologizing for rambling.</p>
<p>Right away this seems odd since I don&#8217;t know this guy at all, and I don&#8217;t<br/>
give out my phone number.  How he got it I&#8217;m not sure, but I start doing<br/>
some digging.  I get his phone number from the voice mail envelope and<br/>
then find out that he called me on <strong>Saturday</strong>.  He must have called when I<br/>
was in the subway and dumb fuck Verizon didn&#8217;t deliver the message until<br/>
Monday.</p>
<p>I call him and ask him to call me back, and then I hunt down his email<br/>
address and email him too.  While I&#8217;m waiting I collect up this<br/>
information to confirm his story:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='http://www.vimeo.com/mattkaufman'>Here&#8217;s a good picture</a> of who I think<br/>
is the Matthew Kaufman in question.  I can&#8217;t confirm it, but all the info<br/>
matches.</li>
	<li><a href='http://twitter.com/mattisbusy'>Here&#8217;s his twitter</a> with the same picture<br/>
so that confirms more.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.linkedin.com/ppl/webprofile?action=vmi&amp;id=10400746&amp;authToken=LdCh&amp;authType=name&amp;trk=ppro_viewmore&amp;lnk=vw_pprofile'>His LinkedIn profile</a> says that he &#8220;Served as <span class='caps'>CTO</span> and Sr. Developer at portfolio company RootZoo, an online sports social network&#8230;&#8221; for Marlin Capital.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.zoominfo.com/people/Brauser_Michael_129848220.aspx'>Michael Brauser has a ZoomInfo</a><br/>
which lists him as a partner at Marlin Capital.  This makes Matthew&#8217;s<br/>
voice mail even weirder because Matthew obviously worked with Michael, so<br/>
why would he forget where Michael worked?</li>
	<li>I can&#8217;t find any phone numbers for Marlin Capital Partners, and their website is down.  There&#8217;s <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/news.admin.net-abuse.email/msg/88f3d80eb3e597d6'>this mention</a> of what could be the company but that number doesn&#8217;t work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other google searches confirm his address and other coherent parts of<br/>
his voice mail.  The only problem is, nobody I know in Ruby or otherwise<br/>
has ever heard of Matthew or Michael.</p>
<p>I left a few more messages with Matt and then decided that if he didn&#8217;t<br/>
call me back by tonight I&#8217;d call the police and have them go find him.<br/>
Well, he didn&#8217;t call me back so I called 911 to see if they can try to<br/>
find out what happened.</p>
<p><span class='caps'>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</span>  Oh man, yeah I almost thought the police<br/>
would actually do their jobs too.  I guess Matt would have to have brown<br/>
skin and try to go on the subway with a backpack before they&#8217;d go<br/>
searching anywhere near him.  In the end I called 911 and my local<br/>
precinct and they just shuffled me on to another precinct.  They said that<br/>
they probably can&#8217;t do anything since Matt&#8217;s an adult.  They also kept<br/>
asking me stupid irrelevant fucking questions like whether he&#8217;s from New<br/>
York.  As if the <span class='caps'>NYPD</span> only helps native New Yorkers yo!</p>
<p>If I get more information I&#8217;ll go down to the police precinct in person<br/>
and try again, but I&#8217;ll have better luck helping the guy with the<br/>
Internet.  My gut also tells me that he&#8217;s probably alright and I just need<br/>
to confirm that.</p>
<h3>What Happens Next</h3>
<p>After putting together the story I think Matt is probably alright.  I&#8217;m<br/>
not going to speculate as to what Michael Brauser did or didn&#8217;t do, or<br/>
even if Matt is telling the truth.  He sounded like he needed help, so I&#8217;m<br/>
going to see if I can get him some.</p>
<p>What I can figure is he&#8217;s at least been kicked out of his apartment and<br/>
doesn&#8217;t have a job.  He&#8217;s not answering his phone, voice mail, or email so<br/>
that could mean he&#8217;s embarrassed that I&#8217;m contacting him, or he&#8217;s dead in a<br/>
ditch somewhere.  There&#8217;s a good chance he&#8217;s not even in the city anymore<br/>
and has just gone home to Mom and Dad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to at least know if he&#8217;s alright.  He&#8217;s a total stranger<br/>
I&#8217;ve <strong>never</strong> met before, but I can at least ask if anyone knows him.</p>
<p>If you know Matthew, and know he&#8217;s alright, then please email me.  If you<br/>
have other information then please let me know that as well.  If you know<br/>
how I can contact Michael Brauser please send me that information.  I&#8217;d<br/>
like to call Michael to get his side of the story and maybe track down<br/>
Matthew through Michael.</p>
<h3>The Lesson To Learn</h3>
<p>Go to a party.  Make some friends.  Date a girl or a guy you like.  Date<br/>
several, if you can.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t get to a point in your life where you have to call<br/>

<p>I am not The A-Team.</p></div></content><updated>2008-10-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-10-28.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-10-05.html</id><title type='text'>2008-10-05</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Taking a break from more and more guitar practice I decided to weigh in on the<br/>
current banking &#8220;crisis&#8221;.</p>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve missed it, people with lots of money are trying to scare<br/>
people without money.  They are claiming <a href='http://stanleybing.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/10/01/are-you-angry-enough/'>nothing short of societal<br/>
collapse</a><br/>
and that if Americans don&#8217;t give the rich who screwed everything up<br/>
close to <a href='http://www.fedupusa.org/'>850 billion</a> dollars then we&#8217;re going to<br/>
have another Great Depression!</p>
<p>Now, I can&#8217;t predict the future, and I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s going to be<br/>
bad things happening.  I&#8217;ll wager most likely someone&#8217;s screwed, but<br/>
probably only the major banks that fucked everything up for us in the<br/>
first place.  I do not enjoy the thought of bailing these asswipes out<br/>
without something in return.  I also despise the fact that they&#8217;re trying<br/>
to convince &#8220;Main Street&#8221; that it will prevent another depression.</p>
<p>However, I have an idea that may make this a fair trade.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ll Trade Your Golden Parachute For Some Surgery</h2>
<p>Just in case everyone forgot what capitalism is all about, it&#8217;s about trade<br/>
by contract.  It is <strong>not</strong> about fucking corporations.  It&#8217;s about me giving<br/>
you money, which binds you into a contract to give me a service.  Any time<br/>
I don&#8217;t get something in return (even a single penny) it&#8217;s called an<br/>
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscionability'>unconscionable contract</a><br/>
and<br/>
lacks consideration.</p>
<p>My problem with any bailout is that I&#8217;m not getting anything in return.  I<br/>
mean, I&#8217;d trade my tax money for bailing out a few banks if maybe I saw<br/>
some CEOs get put to the guillotine.  I am actually not joking about that.<br/>
I think the quickest way to get the bailout approved is to drag the <br/>
leadership of every bank in the country into a large stadium and begin<br/>
beheading them on national TV.  Then threaten to <strong>stop</strong> the beheadings if<br/>
every American doesn&#8217;t donate fifteen-thousand dollars by Monday.</p>
<p>Well, beheadings are a little old fashioned, but what about a fair trade?</p>
<p><strong>Why don&#8217;t we trade the bankers tons of money for socialized medicine?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s fucking brilliant because it trades one form of socialism for another<br/>
form.  They get corporate socialism in the form of bank holdings being<br/>
purchased and we get free medical care for every American forever.  I mean,<br/>
they&#8217;re being bailed out forever, so that&#8217;s only fair.</p>
<p>This may seem radical, but it&#8217;s actually not too far fetched.  Take a look<br/>
at what we could be buying:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='http://finance.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NYSE:AIG'><span class='caps'>AIG</span></a> is a huge<br/>
insurance company that could run the insurance.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.freddiemac.com/'>Freddie Mac</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae'>Fannie<br/>
Mae</a> are loan providers that can<br/>
provide loans for hospitals, housing, clinics, etc.</li>
	<li>Any banks doomed to die like Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Merrill<br/>
Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley become the Sovereign Wealth Fund Of<br/>
The United States and work completely to reduce the American tax burden and<br/>
fund health care.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the bailout would then change from saving a bunch<br/>
of rich assholes who fucked up the economy, to turning these rich assholes<br/>
into socialists.  What we&#8217;d get is a fully functional sovereign wealth fund<br/>
that exists to power an autonomous arm of the government providing health<br/>
insurance for free.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one final catch to this plan which makes it brilliant:  Doctors and<br/>
hospitals still stay private corporations that take loans rather than<br/>
partake of the socialized system.  This is essential because in countries<br/>
where both the insurance and the care are socialized, the government has too<br/>
much control over who gets treated and how.  By having the two sides at<br/>
odds, we&#8217;ll have a competitive system that should function more smoothly.</p>
<h2>But Free Medicine For Kids Isn&#8217;t Capitalist!</h2>
<p>Neither is buying bad assets from failed entrepreneurs.  You didn&#8217;t see the<br/>
government running out to buy failed tech startups when we went into the<br/>
shitter in 2000.  Incidentally, all of that was caused by these same<br/>
bankers running massive pump-and-dump schemes using shitty technology<br/>
companies.  Yet, you didn&#8217;t see them running around begging to save these<br/>
start-ups.  They just let them die and took it on the chin from Elliot<br/>
Spitzer.</p>
<p>Which brings up another thing I haven&#8217;t heard anyone mention:  Who actually<br/>
owns these assets we&#8217;ll be buying at above market value?  Homeowners you<br/>
say?  Really?  The &#8220;homeowners&#8221; who &#8220;own&#8221; their homes because they got a<br/>
loan from a bank under shady circumstances?  <strong>Those</strong> homeowners?</p>
<p>Nope, really the banks do.  That&#8217;s the part that&#8217;s so funny.  Congress and<br/>
everyone is running around saying that we&#8217;ll be buying &#8220;distressed assets&#8221;<br/>
as if we&#8217;ll be handing out free houses to the poor or saving some kid from<br/>
losing his favorite spider man wallpaper.  No such thing is going on.<br/>
We&#8217;re handing a shit load of money to rich banks so they don&#8217;t have to do<br/>
their jobs.</p>
<p>Their jobs?  Yes, what&#8217;s really happening is the wealthy banks don&#8217;t want<br/>
to go through the usual bankruptcy process.  Our bankruptcy laws were<br/>
created because of the Great Depression for just this very situation.  When<br/>
people take out too much credit, they have to negotiate with their<br/>
creditors to save some kind of value and build more favorable terms, or to<br/>
wash the debt away.  The risk to the borrower is they can&#8217;t get credit<br/>
again for many years, but that&#8217;s how it should be.</p>
<p>Instead, banks want to have their cake and eat it with extra peanut butter.<br/>
They want the poor and middle classes to pay for the property with taxes,<br/>
and they want to take that property from the people who are currently<br/>
living there.  Our government won&#8217;t buy these homes and give them to the<br/>
people.  They will pay for them and then hand them back to the banks to<br/>
sell again at the new market rate.</p>
<h2>Go Ahead, Just Give Me Health Care</h2>
<p>Back when Bear Stearns ate it I knew something was up.  The weekend prior<br/>
to Bear&#8217;s demise I was in late working and there were about 60 people<br/>
dressed in business clothes running around in a panic.  One week later, the<br/>
company died horribly.</p>
<p>I also predicted that other banks would die too.  Then they started to die.<br/>
Then I found out that the <a href='http://www.nysun.com/business/ex-sec-official-blames-agency-for-blow-up/86130/'><span class='caps'>SEC</span> gave Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Merrill<br/>
Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan<br/>
Stanley</a><br/>
special exemptions on their dept-to-capital ratios.</p>
<p>I now predict that the &#8220;assets&#8221; we&#8217;ll buy up are only the ones owned by<br/>
these five extinct or soon to be extinct companies.  The impact will<br/>
probably not extend much farther than these five.</p>
<p>Yes, you see, our friends in the <span class='caps'>SEC</span> gave a bunch of companies who had a<br/>
history of fucking over the economy many times in the past even less<br/>
limitations on their actions.  These companies then went ape shit and built<br/>
up such massive debt that it crushed them into the center of the earth.</p>
<p>This involves the government and legislators so that means they owe me<br/>
twice over.</p>
<p><strong>If I bail any companies out, I get health care.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s that simple.  Any bank that partakes of the giant fund becomes part of<br/>
the Sovereign Wealth fund.  I&#8217;ve already paid for <span class='caps'>AIG</span>, Freddie Mac, and<br/>
Fannie Mae, so they&#8217;re part of it as well.  <span class='caps'>AIG</span> runs the insurance, the<br/>
others make money so I pay less taxes.  It&#8217;s a simple solution.</p>
<h2>Libertarians Can Suck My Dick</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve always hated Libertarians because they have a distorted idiotic idea<br/>
of economics.  Their view of economics comes from living in a world where<br/>
there is a solid rule of law already.  In our world, we&#8217;ve got a government<br/>
that does set limits on what companies can do because companies are fucking<br/>
stupid and they fuck over the customers.  In true capitalism you can&#8217;t have<br/>
economics without a rule of law to act as the advocate of the customer.</p>
<p>Libertarians seem to think that companies could run things better.  It&#8217;s<br/>
interesting that any dumbfuck who thinks this hasn&#8217;t worked for a giant<br/>
company before.  Fuck, for any company.  Most companies can barely shit in<br/>
their toilets, let alone run the fucking government.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put this into perspective:  I bought some MP3s from Amazon to study<br/>
for class, and then I bought some Led Zeplin albums.  Amazon&#8217;s entire only<br/>
purpose is to send me content.  They are the masters of it.  Yet, these<br/>
dumbfucks screwed up my download midway, marked my download as completed,<br/>
and then refused to refund my money or give me the rest of the download.</p>
<p>Yes, I want fucking Amazon running the government.  They can&#8217;t give me $30<br/>
of fucking .mp3 files, but they&#8217;re going to do shit like process taxes.<br/>
You realize the <span class='caps'>IRS</span> processes <strong>every</strong> American&#8217;s taxes, the taxes of all<br/>
corporations, <strong>and</strong> manages to fucking audit people accurately enough that<br/>
we are deathly afraid of them?  Most companies can&#8217;t even figure out how to<br/>
collect 20 bucks from a single guy.</p>
<p>The <span class='caps'>SEC</span> has finally given me even better ammunition against Libertarians.<br/>
By <strong>not</strong> enforcing rules against these banks they demonstrated that without<br/>
a strong rule of law watching out for the consumers, corporatists (not<br/>
capitalists) will fuck themselves and everyone else in a greed fueled<br/>
myopic frenzy for money.  With the rules in place watching out for the<br/>
population,and a strong enforcement arm, we get well run companies despite<br/>
themselves.</p>
<p>In the future, if a Libertarian or a false Republican tries to tell me that<br/>
I can&#8217;t have health care because it&#8217;s not capitalist, I&#8217;m gonna kick them<br/>
in the fucking face and stomp their eyes out.</p></div></content><updated>2008-10-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-10-05.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-09-29.html</id><title type='text'>2008-09-29</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I read Obie&#8217;s <a href='http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2008/09/lovin-every-minute-of-it.html'>most recent<br/>
post</a><br/>
about his intense passion for Loverboy&#8217;s quintessential anthem, &#8220;Lovin&#8217;<br/>
Every Minute Of It&#8221;.  I find the early 1980&#8217;s music is inspiring and<br/>
uplifting and definitely suited to such important things as corporate<br/>
culture, recruiting, and motivating the troops to do better.  Yes, nothing<br/>
gets a worker working better than a little Loverboy right in their ear.</p>
<p>Yet, I feel that this rendition is sadly not up to the task of helping Obie<br/>
in his quest to explain to outsiders just what an important and relevant<br/>
impact Loverboy has on the world.  The important part of &#8220;Lovin&#8217; Every<br/>
Minute Of It&#8221; is obviously the lyrics.  There needs to be a version that<br/>
showcases the fine lyrical talents of whatever corporate writer Fairbain<br/>
was able to acquire.  Such gems as:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
I got fun, You want some,
I'm ever ready DR. love,
I'm antennae aerial,
I'm tuning in my control, Whoa
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>with it&#8217;s subtle reference to robot love, masturbation, and teledildonics<br/>
tightly wrapped in a single bridge <strong>and</strong> demonstrating a keen sense of<br/>
rhythmic prowess by closing out the tension created by &#8220;control&#8221; with<br/>
&#8220;Whoa&#8221;.  This bridge (one of many in the song, where other&#8217;s might have a<br/>
single bridge) also manages to hint at the robot&#8217;s erection<br/>
directly, but without such crass language as you might find in a rap album<br/>
today:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
I got a cock
I'm ready to roll
It's hard like a rock
Now suck it robot bitch!  I'm in control, Whoa!
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As we can see, the &#8220;gangsta&#8221; rap version of the same lyric, while clearer,<br/>
doesn&#8217;t have the same nuance and depth of teledildonics understanding as the<br/>
<span class='caps'>LEMOI</span> lyric.</p>
<p>Because of the overwhelming importance of this song to Obie, Hashrocket,<br/>
and Vancouver, I present to you my rendition on ukelele which features the<br/>
Loverboy-Fairbain lyrical genius prominently.</p>
<p>You may partake of an <a href='/lovin_every_minute_of_obie.ogg'>Ogg Version</a> or a<br/>

exclusively for the next year.  This is something I&#8217;ve always wanted to<br/>
do, but just never had the chance.  Either I wasn&#8217;t good enough (being<br/>
self-taught for so many years) or I just didn&#8217;t have the money.<br/>
After being laid off and getting a small package I decided to practice<br/>
my ass off on the guitar, do a few live shows to get ready, and then<br/>
audition for a school in the city.</p>
<p>I definitely freaked about it, and waited until the last Friday before the school<br/>
opened on Monday.  I made an appointment, walked in, sat with the director, and<br/>
went through the small audition.  I was very nervous, since playing music is about<br/>
the only thing that I&#8217;m intimidated by these days, but I did well enough to get<br/>
into the one year program.  I was just hoping to do six months, but when I was<br/>
offered to do one year I decided to just go for it and bust my ass.</p>
<p>As the director said, I&#8217;m not quite good enough to be in the program, but being<br/>
older and motivated means I can probably pull it off.  So far he&#8217;s been right, since <br/>
I&#8217;m having to pick up a ton of extra things you don&#8217;t learn when you teach yourself.<br/>
Simple things like the best way to actually practice, or why I keep<br/>
lifting my pinky too much when I play.</p>
<p>I get up at 6:30am every day and practice for 4-6 hours if I can.  I&#8217;m<br/>
easily the <strong>worst</strong> musician there which is both kind of scary (especially<br/>
at my age) and also very fun.  Having so many younger better<br/>
qualified people to interact with and learn from is great.  Hell, I&#8217;m even<br/>
older than a few of my instructors and some of the people who run the<br/>
school.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s basically all I&#8217;ve been doing, that and writing when I can.  I<br/>
finished off a ton of my electronics projects, like the <a href='http://www.paia.com/proddetail.asp?prod=9506K&amp;cat=27'>PAiA Mid-Side<br/>
Mic</a> and now I&#8217;m<br/>
putting them on hold during school.  The mid-side mic was very fun to put<br/>
together, and PAiA does a good job making the kits they sell.  This one is<br/>
great because it&#8217;s just large enough to challenge your electronics<br/>
construction skills, without being so large that when you fuck it up you<br/>
can&#8217;t fix it.</p>
<p>In this case, there&#8217;s a small errata section at the beginning that mentions<br/>
two tiny little jumper wires you have to add.  At first I didn&#8217;t have these in<br/>
so it wasn&#8217;t working.   After I read about those two, and managed to find the<br/>
little bastards, I installed them and the thing work great.  It has a few flaws<br/>
like the mics are a bit too sensitive, and they need to have screens on them,<br/>
but otherwise the thing is awesome for recording my ukelele or harmonica.</p>
<p>The funniest thing about this mic is how people react to it.  I first show<br/>
it to them and they go, &#8220;You made this?&#8221;  I tell them it was a kit but yes<br/>
I assembled it and got it working.  Then they hear it and freak out since<br/>
it makes things far away from you sound like their right by your head.  It also<br/>
has weird features like if you pull one of the 1/4&quot; jacks, the other jack <br/>
takes over and &#8220;downmixes&#8221; the stereo sound image to mono for the remaining<br/>
jack.  It&#8217;s a very nice microphone, especially for $120 including<br/>
shipping (and my time to assemble, but that&#8217;s just fun).</p>
<p>Some guy even bought me a biscotti when he saw it because he was<br/>
impressed.  He was also kind of strange and asked me if I was straight or<br/>
gay, so yeah, I&#8217;m just happy I only got a biscotti.</p>
<p>After that I&#8217;ve been running the FU meetings.  The next one is on the 25th of<br/>
Sep. and we&#8217;re doing a visual show.  People will show off paintings and a weird<br/>
visual debugger.  I may bring something, and as usually I&#8217;ll be icecasting the <br/>
whole thing live so you can listen to the fun.</p>
<h2>If You Had The Chance, Would You?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve been doing.  Guitar, writing, and FU.  Now, some people when<br/>
I tell them that I basically used a huge chunk of my severance to learn <br/>
music at my age ask, &#8220;What are you going to do with it?&#8221;   Well I could<br/>
come back with, &#8220;I just wanna rock.&#8221;  Which is partially true, but<br/>
obviously in my own weird little way.  Another answer is that I want to<br/>
make tech for musicians, but the truth is I want to be a musician who<br/>
makes tech for himself.</p>
<p>The better question is why people think that the things they learn only<br/>
have value if there&#8217;s money potential.  Yes, I understand more than anyone<br/>
that being poor sucks and that many people can&#8217;t even eat let alone attend<br/>
a fancy music school.  This is why if I have the chance to study now, and<br/>
I don&#8217;t take it, then I&#8217;ll have wasted an opportunity other people would<br/>
kill to have.</p>
<p>For me however, the biggest reason is I&#8217;ve got something to say, and I<br/>
think music is the best way to say it.  When I&#8217;m done with my year of<br/>
school, I&#8217;ll be able to use my knowledge to express myself, my ideas, and<br/>
the things I want to say.  It may never make me any money, but it will<br/>
make me a better person.</p>
<p>The reason music appeals to me now as a way to express my feelings and<br/>
ideas is that, unlike code, people expect you to be weird or creative<br/>
with sound.  When I tell people the software I write is art, or if I make<br/>
something weird just as a joke, they look at me funny or roll their eyes.<br/>
To them, coding is how they put potatoes on their plate.  It&#8217;s not art,<br/>
and I should shut the fuck up and get back to work.</p>
<p>When I write, people seem to enjoy the humor and the information, but very<br/>
rarely enjoy the creative writing I do.  Hell, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve written<br/>
anything creative in years.  It&#8217;s all informational technical writing or<br/>
funny blog posts.  The reaction this form of expression receives is powerful,<br/>
but only in the opinion forming or political-social way.  The popularity<br/>
of the phrase, &#8220;Steak and Strippers&#8221; from my blog is a good example of how<br/>
my writing influences people.</p>
<p>Yet, with music I can play a wide range of styles and tunes, compose<br/>
little tiny songs or bing horrible evil ones, and people will react in<br/>
more direct varied ways.  Sometimes it&#8217;s, &#8220;God I wish he&#8217;d quit playing.&#8221;<br/>
Other times, <a href='http://smartic.us/2008/7/23/zed-shaw-ringtone-matz-can-t-patch'>they make my stuff into a<br/>
ringtone</a><br/>
and preserve the joke for future generations.</p>
<p>With music I can write sad songs, or happy ones, or funny stuff (yay<br/>
ukelele) and even get serious and deadly if I feel like it.  People will<br/>
listen even when I&#8217;m just noodling around on a little thumb board over<br/>
the internet.  People just generally like different interesting music and<br/>
respond to any range of emotions I can put into it.</p>
<p>With code, they hate emotion.  People will actually email me to ask that I<br/>
not put &#8220;curse words&#8221; into my open source projects.  With code, nobody<br/>
appreciates the huge amount of work that went into the little web server<br/>
that runs their massive business operations.  With my writing and<br/>
public speaking they expect me to be a raving lunatic asshole<br/>
(which is kind of cool too).</p>
<p>Music though gives me the chance to be more myself, and just write songs<br/>
or say whatever the hell I want.  No pretense about it, just me dorking<br/>
around making something I feel like making.</p>
<p>Well, actually, when I get better at playing that is.</p></div></content><updated>2008-09-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-09-17.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-09-04.html</id><title type='text'>2008-09-04</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>The Freehackers Union <span class='caps'>NYC</span> show went insanely well.

22khz, and a &#8220;flyby&#8221; that&#8217;s the low version but sped up so you can listen<br/>
to it fast.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be uploading video of the event to the same place and then I&#8217;ll look<br/>
at automating this process more.</p>
<h2>How The Live Audio Worked</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of still wondering how it all worked, but it worked great and<br/>
didn&#8217;t have many problems other than the audio levels.</p>
<p>What I did was setup an icecast server running on zedshaw.com that people<br/>
could connect to with their browsers and various streaming media players.<br/>
Then at the FU <span class='caps'>NYC</span> show I used the icecast client ices to relay the audio<br/>
out over the internet, to the icecast server, then out to everyone<br/>
listening.  The people who were listening then were hanging in <span class='caps'>IRC</span> and<br/>
could ask questions realtime and get responses.</p>
<p>In order to make it just a bit more complicated I took my Yamaha mixer<br/>
board with me and used that to do the audio recording.  This let me plug<br/>
in the mic, an iPod, and any sound demos people had without much hassle.<br/>
When people were setting up and there was down time, I played some<br/>
classical music for the people on <span class='caps'>IRC</span> to listen to and not get bored.</p>
<p>It worked out great, so I&#8217;m gonna look at this for some of the UnLocal<br/>
technology we&#8217;re building.  (UnLocal is the virtual local we&#8217;re building).</p>
<h2>Interviewing My Peeps Is Not Interviewing Me</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a few friends and former employees tell me that knowing me sucks<br/>
when they try to get a Rails gig.  Apparently, there&#8217;s some assholes out<br/>
there who are bringing in former employees for interviews <strong>only</strong> to ask<br/>
them what it&#8217;s like to work for me.  These companies don&#8217;t even have jobs,<br/>
they just want to pump my friends for information on me.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little advice to all the shithead startups in <span class='caps'>NYC</span> that are doing<br/>
this:</p>
<p>This is incredibly unprofessional, and can backfire on you quick.  While<br/>
you may say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not illegal,&#8221; you&#8217;d be wrong.  All someone has to do is<br/>
call the <span class='caps'>EEO</span> and claim that your hiring practices are racist or sexist and<br/>
the investigation alone can get you fired.  For a smaller company the<br/>
negative publicity from my blog alone could crush you, not to mention all<br/>
the many friends I have in various activist networks.  Calls to local<br/>
unions, government agencies, publications I&#8217;ve written for, and blogs that<br/>
I&#8217;m connected with can destroy what little image you have left.</p>
<p>More importantly, when I get pissed at someone and start writing about<br/>
them, they die.  Just ask anyone who was creating a Rails startup when I<br/>
called <a href='/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>Rails a ghetto</a> and exposed that<br/>
shitfest.  After I wrote that essay, Thoughtworks called in the big guy<br/>
Roy to call all my managers and try to get me fired.  He of course didn&#8217;t<br/>
call me (because I&#8217;m impervious to his Neuro-Linguistic Programming mind<br/>
tricks) but think about that for a minute.  I wrote a single essay<br/>
that scared a large company enough that they started using their biggest<br/>
hitters to come after me.</p>
<p>In short, don&#8217;t fuck with my friends.</p>
<p>You can fuck with me all you want, but some people I barely even know who<br/>
are looking for work should be treated fairly and professionally.</p>
<p>( and people wonder why I started <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/'>Freehackers Union</a> )</p>
<p>(( and to the redditors who will say &#8220;he deserves it&#8221;, you are proving my<br/>
   point you morons ))</p></div></content><updated>2008-09-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-09-04.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-09-01.html</id><title type='text'>2008-09-01</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p><strong><span class='caps'>UPDATE</span>: Fixed the bzr repo for SoS.</strong></p>

<h2>Announcing &#8220;Son of Sam&#8221;</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve started a fun email server project I&#8217;m calling &#8220;Son of Sam&#8221;, or SoS for short.<br/>
It&#8217;s really just an attempt to bring modern web development techniques to doing mail<br/>
applications.  I&#8217;m mostly just sick of duct taping together a shit ton of stupid<br/>
processes just to get an email server to be smarter.  Based on my experiments <br/>
so far, doing a new email server isn&#8217;t really too hard, thanks to Python.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still rough, but you can grab the source as it is now (GPLv3 licensed) from:</p>
bzr branch http://zedshaw.com/repository/sos/
<p>In there you&#8217;ll find the code and a sample application.  It&#8217;s a little tricky to <br/>
try it out right now, but take a look at the sample directory to see where I&#8217;m<br/>
going with the application.  I think in a few days it&#8217;ll be good enough for<br/>
me to use on chaos2congress.us and freehackersunion.org.  It already can<br/>
route emails to various handlers that you can write based on regexes,<br/>
process emails in stages using a Finite State Machine, and send emails<br/>
that it receives.  Up next is generating emails in response or to send to<br/>
others and probably a bit of queue management.</p>
<p>Son of Sam came about because the easiest to use mailing list for freehackersunion.org<br/>
was <a href='http://www.mml.org.ua/'>Minimalist</a> and even that was a total bitch to configure.<br/>
It involved aliases numerous times in different <a href='http://www.postfix.org/'>Postfix</a> files,<br/>
other files in a spool directory for minimalist, permissions being just right, and <br/>
tons of tinkering with text files.</p>
<p>Compared to a modern web application framework like Django or Rails this was like doing<br/>
raw cgi-bin processing.  It seems like <span class='caps'>SMTP</span> servers are just nowhere near as flexible<br/>
or easy to modify as <span class='caps'>HTTP</span> servers, and I&#8217;m sure email guys have their reasons, but<br/>
I&#8217;m also sure all their reasons are total bullshit these days.</p>
<p>This lead me to check out what was available for a &#8220;<span class='caps'>WSGI</span> for <span class='caps'>SMTP</span>&#8221; and<br/>
only thing I found was Sendmail&#8217;s <a href='https://www.milter.org/'>milter</a> version<br/>
8.  Wow, what a piece of shit protocol.  It&#8217;s really only documented in C<br/>
code, and you have to build an entire Sendmail to get at just the library<br/>
and headers.  What amazed me though, is motherfuckers are actually<br/>
<strong>selling</strong> milter clients based on this.  I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re making<br/>
money, but that&#8217;s simply impressive.  Like those African dudes who can<br/>
build whole Vespas out of wood and raw metal.</p>
<p>After much annoyance at playing with milter I decided to see how hard it would be to<br/>
do just a plain old framework in Python.  Just something that looks and works like<br/>
Django, web.py, TurboGears, <span class='caps'>PHP</span>, Ruby on Rails, Merb, hell even video games have <br/>
simplification engines and frameworks these days.  Why is <span class='caps'>SMTP</span> so brain dead?</p>
<p>A quick googling around and I find out that<br/>
<a href='http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/'>Twisted</a> does <span class='caps'>SMTP</span> (as well as shave dogs<br/>
and smelt gold), but that plain Python does a decent enough job already<br/>
(<a href='http://lakin.weckers.net/thoughts/twisted/part1/threaded/'>here&#8217;s the<br/>
 code</a>).  Lakin<br/>
Wecker did a good job of breaking the difference down and showing the<br/>
kernel of the idea.  I took his pointers, and then went and read up on<br/>
what&#8217;s available.</p>
<p>Python clearly is the email processing god.  It has everything you&#8217;d ever<br/>
need, and really I think only Perl would compare in pure number of<br/>
libraries to do all the bizarre email tricks.  With a nearly complete<br/>
simple <span class='caps'>SMTP</span> server already baked into Python, and full <span class='caps'>SMTP</span> client<br/>
libraries, plus all the other goodies from the web framework world<br/>
(<a href='http://www.sqlalchemy.org/'>SQLAlchemy</a>, <a href='http://www.makotemplates.org/'>Mako<br/>
 Templates</a>) it didn&#8217;t seem too hard to<br/>
crank out a little sample.</p>
<p>Started it on Saturday, worked for a few hours, hacked on it Monday for a few hours,<br/>
and now I&#8217;ve got the start of a nice little framework for doing intelligent email<br/>
applications.  I&#8217;ve <strong>even</strong> got a simple Finite State Machine class that lets you<br/>
hold conversations over email with the state of each step controlled and stored <br/>
to disk between receipts.</p>
<p>So, if this works out, I&#8217;m gonna make it the mailing list software for freehackersunion.org<br/>
to test it out.  After that, I think it would work great as a first step in<br/>
taking on some of the messed up incumbents who voted for <span class='caps'>FISA</span> through chaos2congress.us.</p></div></content><updated>2008-09-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-09-01.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-27.html</id><title type='text'>2008-08-27</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p><a href='http://freehackersunion.org/'>FU</a> is turning out to be a fun as fuck<br/>
project to work on.  I think the gear needed for people to communicate<br/>
is nearly complete.  Here&#8217;s what we got:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='http://freehackersunion.org/lists.html'>Mailing lists</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://freehackersunion.org/archives/'>Mailing list archives</a> with<br/>
several of the locals already with good starter memberships.  Boston=8, <span class='caps'>NYC</span>=16, <br/>
Toronto=3, San Francisco=3, Atlanta=2.</li>
	<li>Very active <span class='caps'>IRC</span> channel with tons of crazy chatter.  While a lot of it<br/>
is seemingly off-topic, it shows everyone is itching to get going.</li>
	<li>Boston and <span class='caps'>NYC</span> are planning short meetings tonight.
	<ul>
		<li><a href='http://freehackersunion.org/archives/boston-ma-us/0000.html'>Boston&#8217;s Announce</a></li>
		<li><a href='http://freehackersunion.org/archives/new-york-ny-us/0009.html'>NYC&#8217;s Announce</a></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Boston and <span class='caps'>NYC</span> are planning their first newbie show for <strong>September 3rd</strong>.</li>
	<li>People from Toronto are talking about flying in for the <span class='caps'>NYC</span> show.</li>
	<li>Every local can have its own mailing list, just ask.</li>
	<li>A <a href='http://wiki.freehackersunion.org/'>full MoinMoin wiki</a> for everyone to<br/>
collaborate on their ideas and locals.  There&#8217;s already several locals<br/>
with complete pages.  Yes it&#8217;s password protected.  Any list password you<br/>
have will get you in.</li>
	<li>A total of <strong>150 subscribers</strong> to the <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/archives/converse/'>converse list</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is going very well too.  The choice to use simple tech of just a<br/>
basic site, a mailing list system, <span class='caps'>IRC</span>, and now a wiki has been crucial.</p>
<p>I think another thing that&#8217;s happened is, because the site is on its own<br/>
domain and doesn&#8217;t use services from other vendors, people feel that it&#8217;s<br/>
more for them.  I&#8217;m starting to formulate this idea that when a group puts<br/>
their mailing list on say yahoo or google they kind of dilute the group&#8217;s<br/>
identity.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re now going to start working on the podcast system.  If anyone has<br/>
suggestions on good podcast practices let me know.</p></div></content><updated>2008-08-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-27.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-25.html</id><title type='text'>2008-08-25</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I managed to get all the people currently subscribed to <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/'>the Freehacker&#8217;s<br/>
Union</a> <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/archive/'>converse list</a><br/>
to do a roll call so I could gathe the latest list of countries.  This<br/>
also helped them find other people near them quickly.  Here&#8217;s the latest list:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Atlanta-GA-US</li>
	<li>Austin-TX-US</li>
	<li>Baltimore-MD-US</li>

	<li>Greenville-SC-US</li>
	<li>Honolulu-HI-US</li>
	<li>Long_Island-NY-US</li>

	<li>London-UK</li>
	<li>JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤-FI</li>
	<li>Pula-HR</li>
</ul>
<p>To make things easy for the locals to organize, I&#8217;m going to fire up a Wiki<br/>
and give them their own mailing list for coordinating and announcements.<br/>
This should help keep the management of things down to their level and get<br/>
them talking about cool new ideas.  All the messages will be archived so<br/>
we can all spy on other groups.</p>
<p>After that we gotta setup the FU Local Podcast.  This will need to be a<br/>
system where locals can send in the recording of their shows and then<br/>
we share them out with all the other locals.  This should really make<br/>
things interesting.</p>
<p>A couple members are working on the idea of an &#8220;unlocal&#8221; system, which<br/>
will let people who are too few in number to have virtual shows<br/>
over the internet.  They&#8217;re already talking about a freeswitch server<br/>
to run a <span class='caps'>SIP</span> router that records whoever calls in.  If we can get that<br/>
to broadcast at the same time then we can possibly do &#8220;FU Local Radio&#8221;<br/>
and feed the PodCast automagically.</p>
<h2>Avoiding Elitism (Sent To The List)</h2>
<p>I wanted to throw out a quick word on elitism in Freehacker&#8217;s Union and<br/>
get people talking about what it means to them.</p>
<p>First off, let&#8217;s look at the mission once again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The Freehacker&#8217;s Union is a gang devoted to preserving hacking and<br/>
invention as methods of personal artistic expression.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expressing things to more people is more fun.  Preservation also means<br/>
sharing this stuff with other people who could continue the tradition.<br/>
Keeping people out is going to make the mission more difficult.<br/>
However, letting in people we all hate (that business dipshit) would<br/>
make things suck all over again.  They&#8217;ve got plenty of places to go,<br/>
and we have very few.  How do we balance this?</p>
<p>Personally, I fucking hate elitist asswipes.  One of the themes I&#8217;m<br/>
silently mixing into FU is a kind of parody elitism.  We&#8217;ll keep out the<br/>
people who usually keep people out, by just being rough on the edges.<br/>
We&#8217;ll give newbies a hazing with a five minute show as an initiation to<br/>
the joke.  This &#8220;newbie show&#8221; should be how they say, &#8220;I&#8217;m here to<br/>
play.&#8221;</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be, &#8220;Please let me in so I can be cool like you<br/>
guys.&#8221;  Because really, I&#8217;m personally trying to take a piss on &#8220;cool&#8221;<br/>
by turning it on its head with a group that does interesting things with<br/>
nerdy gear.  A group that says, &#8220;Right dude, nice fucking suit and<br/>
tie.  I&#8217;ve got an art show with my computer in a few minutes so enjoy<br/>
your mojito douchebag.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I get that we deal with trolls all day long, and some people&#8217;s<br/>
worst nightmare is having a troll show up and screw with a meeting.<br/>
Hell I wrote Utu for that very reason.  But, trolls don&#8217;t generally<br/>
exist in person.  Think about it, if you have a guy running down the<br/>
street yelling obscentities at you, you have him arrested or punch him<br/>
in the nose.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t generally show up to a meeting and cause trouble, and if<br/>
they do I&#8217;m sure a group of smart people should be able to turn them to<br/>
putty or get them tossed out.</p>
<p>With that in mind, creating rules at locals that are designed to boot<br/>
people out, level membership, create inner circles, play favorites, or<br/>
exclude all but the business morons, should be dropped. We shouldn&#8217;t be<br/>
worried about long protracted rules that need giant legal documents<br/>
backing them.</p>
<p>Focus on the show, not the rules.</p>
<p>I get that we&#8217;re all engineers and it&#8217;s in our nature to solve problems<br/>
before they come, but in this case, just chill and go with it for now.<br/>
Adapt as you go, and consider this an exercise in <strong>not</strong> trying to find<br/>
all the potential flaws before you do something.</p>
<p>And, if your local starts to suck, then you can start your own.  Don&#8217;t<br/>
worry, as long as locals are posting back their meeting recordings<br/>
we&#8217;ll all tell them they&#8217;re a bunch of idiots.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my thoughts on it, how do other people feel about it?</p></div></content><updated>2008-08-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-25.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-24.html</id><title type='text'>2008-08-24</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>This weekend was spent working on <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/'>The Freehacker&#8217;s Union<br/>
website</a> and getting the <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/archives/'>mailing<br/>
list</a> all organized and working<br/>
well.  We held an <span class='caps'>IRC</span> meeting, laid out how things could go, and started<br/>
working on getting all the locals that are interested going.</p>
<p>We are now at 68 subscribers on the mailing list with 163 messages since<br/>
Saturday.  I believe about 20 cities are represented.  New York, Boston<br/>
and Austin seem to have the most, but that was when we had 24 people on<br/>
Saturday.  For all I know there could be more in other cities, there could<br/>
be less.</p>
<p>You can <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/archives/'>subscribe</a> to the list<br/>
yourself and join in the fun if you like what <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/rules.html'>you<br/>
read</a> and think you can hang.</p>
<p>There hasn&#8217;t been an actual meeting just yet, but there&#8217;s been plenty of<br/>
people talking online and getting things going.  I&#8217;m planning my first<br/>
meeting in <span class='caps'>NYC</span> either before or after Labor Day weekend.  We&#8217;ll be running<br/>
<a href='http://freehackersunion.org/joining.html'>our first meeting</a> curated by me<br/>
and inducting as many newbies as possible from as many different cities on<br/>
the east coast as we can.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also going to get all the FU Locals to record their meetings and give<br/>
us audio or video for a podcast.  People can subscribe to find out what&#8217;s<br/>
going on in the locals around the world, and share ideas about how to run<br/>
things and great projects.  It&#8217;ll also spread the shows out to a wider<br/>
audience.</p>
<p>I really like this idea of recording and podcasting the meetings as a<br/>
religious part of how FU operates.  Part of the problem with starting a<br/>
group like FU is that we have enough people for a large meeting in one<br/>
city, but we&#8217;re spread out all over.  If people live in a city with only 3<br/>
friends, then they&#8217;ll be alienated and alone mostly.</p>
<p>However, if they can record their meetings and share them with everyone<br/>
else in The Freehacker&#8217;s Union around the world, then they&#8217;ll get a sense<br/>
of connection.  They do their locals, but at the same time they&#8217;re part of<br/>
a group that has other cultures, different ideas, and strange customs.<br/>
That kind of exposure is bound to make people think of interesting things.</p>
<h2>The Bootstrap Problem</h2>
<p>Usually when you start a group you get together with some friends and you<br/>
four plan it.  My problem is I didn&#8217;t really want to do this group with my<br/>
friends.  It&#8217;s sad to say, and I love them, but they&#8217;re steeped in the very<br/>
world I&#8217;m fighting with this group.  They&#8217;d mostly be too afraid or busy<br/>
to come.</p>
<p>However, I spent many months thinking about the problem and researching<br/>
what was going on.  Identifying the problem and <a href='/rants/the_freehackers_union.html'>articulating<br/>
it</a> clearly for others <strong>is</strong> bootstrapping<br/>
the idea.  By giving what I want to do a name, and then helping other<br/>
people understand my idea, I can work with others to make it happen.</p>
<p>Think of it this way:  In just a few days I&#8217;ve turned a single blog post<br/>
into a global movement that has enough people and cities to grow quickly.<br/>
We&#8217;ve got a website, active mailing lists, and an intelligent <span class='caps'>IRC</span> channel<br/>
people actually chat in.  Hell, we have rules that were organized via a<br/>
quick meeting in <span class='caps'>IRC</span>.</p>
<p>I like this way of getting things going, because even if I can&#8217;t get a<br/>
meeting to happen in person, at least I ran into many people online looking<br/>
to help make it happen.</p>
<p>To think, all I wanted was 10 people who think like me to show up and share<br/>
their gear.  This is much more fun by comparison.</p></div></content><updated>2008-08-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-24.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-23.html</id><title type='text'>2008-08-23</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p><a href='/rants/the_freehackers_union.html'>The Freehacker&#8217;s Union</a> is officially a<br/>

to see so many other people just as pissed off and hungry as myself.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;ve got going is the start of a website, the <span class='caps'>IRC</span> channel for<br/>
chatting, and two mailing lists for coordinating meetings.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also going with the organization structure of having &#8220;FU Locals&#8221;<br/>
that are organized by a &#8220;Curator&#8221; in different areas.  We&#8217;re pushing the<br/>
management and organization of the gatherings down to the locals and trying<br/>
to get each local to report back and share.  The Curator isn&#8217;t in charge,<br/>
he or she just organizes the show.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got locals in these major cities so far:</p>
<ul>
	<li>New York, NY</li>
	<li>Austin, TX</li>
	<li>Greenville, SC</li>
	<li>London, UK</li>
	<li>Boston, MA</li>
	<li>Nottingham, UK</li>
	<li>Salt Lake City, UT</li>
	<li>Sarasota, FL</li>
	<li>Toronto, ON</li>
	<li>Baltimore, MD</li>
	<li>Jyv_skyl_, Finland (sorry, <span class='caps'>UTF</span>-8)</li>
	<li>Phoenix, AZ</li>
	<li>Champaign-Urbana, UL</li>
	<li>Gouda, Netherlands</li>
	<li>Miami/Ft. Lauderdale, FL</li>
	<li>Jacksonville, FL</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of those have about 1-5 people that have started trying to organize.  If you&#8217;re interested<br/>
in joining a local, you can subscribe to our mailing list and introduce yourself.</p>
<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>
<p>The mailing lists are on the <a href='http://freehackersunion.org/'>Freehacker&#8217;s Union<br/>
site</a> server.  The web site is still being<br/>
built, so you can piss off if you hate it.</p>
<p>To subscribe, do this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Send an email to minimalist@freehackersunion.org with the subject<br/>
&#8220;subscribe converse&#8221; without quotes (of course).</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions it gives you and you&#8217;re on.  You then send<br/>
to <strong>converse@freehackersunion.org</strong> after that.</li>
	<li>Do the same with &#8220;subscribe announce&#8221; to get on the announcements list.</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t be a dick.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you get on, introduce yourself and say what local you&#8217;re interested<br/>
in joining or helping with.  I&#8217;ll shoot you <span class='caps'>IRC</span> information once you<br/>
subscribe.</p>
<h2>Next Meetings</h2>
<p>Each local is going to figure out how to organize around the <a href='/rants/the_freehackers_union.html'>rules I<br/>
developed</a> and then they&#8217;ll try to<br/>
do a gathering in the next couple weeks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re shooting for having them record the event somehow so we can <br/>
put it up and share what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re coming up with guidelines and ideas, but the important thing<br/>
is this is an experiment so nothing&#8217;s set in stone just yet (if it<br/>
ever will be).</p>
<p>If you have suggestions, shoot me an email or bring it up on the<br/>
list.</p></div></content><updated>2008-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-23.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-22.html</id><title type='text'>2008-08-22</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>The response to my call for the <a href='/rants/the_freehackers_union.html'>Freehacker&#8217;s<br/>
Union</a> movement was really good.  I<br/>
received emails from 23 people in about 4 different cities interested in<br/>
starting a similar chapter.  Originally it was just going to be in <span class='caps'>NYC</span> but<br/>
I figure we might as well try to make it a global revolution.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing to make that happen:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Someone hooked up a <span class='caps'>IRC</span> channel for me on irc.freenode.org that I want<br/>
everyone to come join so we can hash out our evil plans.  I want to keep<br/>
it a little quiet, so if you are interested and can hack then email me and I&#8217;ll<br/>
shoot you the information.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;m setting up a mailing list system that we can use to continue the<br/>
discussion and to coordinate our activities.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ll be doing a web site for FU that lays out what we come up with as values<br/>
and describes how to join or start a chapter.  I&#8217;ll setup a system for people<br/>
in the chapters to get a mailing list and a wildcard on the site where they can<br/>
post.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ve got someone working on a logo, which I&#8217;ll have everyone take a<br/>
look at and give their vote.  Should happen in a few weeks.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s the initial work, so if you&#8217;re interested in helping out shoot me an email.<br/>
I want to do an <span class='caps'>IRC</span> meeting tomorrow for people to come up with ideas and help <br/>
out.</p>
<p>One thing I want to do as the first hack is see if we can get these<br/>
chapters in other cities all connected over the internet live for the first<br/>
meeting.  Any ideas on that are welcome.</p></div></content><updated>2008-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-22.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-21.html</id><title type='text'>2008-08-21</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I&#8217;ve been head down working on my book, which goes <strong>way</strong> slower than I&#8217;d<br/>
like.  I find it&#8217;s pretty damn hard to get motivated to write sometimes,<br/>
so grinding through produces pages but nothing I admire.  I&#8217;ll probably<br/>
just keep writing and hopefully go back and mix it up a little later.<br/>
Then again <span class='caps'>HTTP</span> is a boring as hell topic, and so absolutely irritating at<br/>
the same time.  It&#8217;s like writing about the damn tax code.</p>
<p>Lately though I&#8217;ve been exploring electronics and music in an attempt to<br/>
combine them better.  As I went through this learning process and tried to<br/>
find other people interested in the intersection of art and hacking, I<br/>
realized that something happened to us geeks.  There just aren&#8217;t that many<br/>
places where we can go to talk about our cool ideas or awesome hacks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like the entire scene was taken over by business pod people only<br/>
interested in how they can flip their stupid startup to Google.  There&#8217;s<br/>
no hard core geeks left, but I know that can&#8217;t be true.  There has to be<br/>
at least 5 or 10 who want to talk about truly wicked weird cool shit they<br/>

readers</a> hit some sites, so I<br/>
should put in a few clarifications so people understand what I was looking<br/>
for more specifically.  I&#8217;ll do it by answering several of the questions<br/>
people sent me.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Why not just use Mutt?&#8221;</h3>
<p>Of course, if I wanted to just use Mutt to read my <span class='caps'>RSS</span> feeds then I could<br/>
easily do that.  This kind of violates the idea of one program doing one<br/>
thing really well, but think about the question for a second.  Don&#8217;t you<br/>
actually mean:  Why not just wire <a href='http://rss2email.infogami.com/'>rss2email</a><br/>
into procmail through bogofilter and tweak endless rules so that you can<br/>
then put an rss article into a single email so that your mail and your news<br/>
are all pleasantly mixed into one big source of information?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a more accurate version of the question.  If I used Mutt as my feed<br/>
reader I <strong>must</strong> also use 10 other programs that balance in a delicate dance<br/>
of configuration files.  If I use<br/>
<a href='http://synflood.at/newsbeuter.html'>Newsbeuter</a> it just start it and it<br/>
works.</p>
<p>Also, Newsbeuter has a ton of other nice features Mutt just doesn&#8217;t have.<br/>
My favorite is Podbeuter, which takes any of the podcast enclosures that<br/>
Newsbeuter found, downloads them in a nice queue, and lets me play them.<br/>
It&#8217;s absolutely the slickest podcast setup yet, and best of all I didn&#8217;t<br/>
have to configure it much.  It just kind of worked.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Mutt does do folders you dumbass!&#8221;</h3>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t.  I know, you have a key for accessing folders.  Yay.  I can<br/>
read a directory of emails.  However, if you want to get pedantic about it<br/>
Mutt actually only <strong>reads</strong> folders.  To even come close to <strong>doing</strong> folders<br/>
Mutt would have to start sorting the email into the folders for me, include<br/>
a rule processing system, and probably run my spam filter for me.  As it<br/>
stands, Mutt relies on shit programs like procmail (fucking hell I hate that<br/>
thing).</p>
<p>I think this demonstrates why many programmers cannot write software for<br/>
other people.  Programmers absolutely love yak shaving.  Hell, I love it to<br/>
death when I know the end result is gonna rock.  For example, right now I&#8217;m<br/>
learning <span class='caps'>FORTH</span> so that I can use<br/>
<a href='http://www.rfc1149.net/devel/picforth'>PicForth</a> to code various embedded<br/>
guitar effects projects using a<br/>
<a href='http://www.microchip.com/ParamChartSearch/chart.aspx?mid=10)&amp;lang=en&amp;branchID=1002'>PIC16</a><br/>
<span class='caps'>CPU</span>.  That&#8217;s some serious fucking yak shaving, but that&#8217;s what makes it fun.</p>
<p>However, where programmers constantly fuck up is they assume that <strong>everyone</strong><br/>
enjoys yak shaving.  They see no problem with a mere mortal setting up<br/>
postfix+stunnel+imapd+procmail+bogofilter+rss2email+Mutt just to read a news<br/>
feed.  Sure, they&#8217;ll claim the journey is simple, right before they dive<br/>
into a Moby Dick level tale of construction and configuration that still<br/>
weeks later only works half as well as Newsbeuter.</p>
<p>So yes, I know you can read a subfolder in Mutt.  That&#8217;s all Mutt does with<br/>
folders, which means Mutt doesn&#8217;t &#8220;do folders&#8221;.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Have you tried Bitlbee for IM-to-<span class='caps'>IRC</span>?&#8221;</h3>
<p>A few folks mentioned <a href='http://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html'>Bitlebee</a><br/>
as an option.  Bitlbee basically takes all your IM accounts and acts as a<br/>
proxy that gives you <span class='caps'>IRC</span> access to them.  You can then use<br/>
<a href='http://www.irssi.org/'>irssi</a> to do both your <span class='caps'>IRC</span> and your IM in one shot.</p>
<p>While this does seem attractive, I never really bothered setting it up.  I<br/>
was fine with <a href='http://www.lilotux.net/~mikael/mcabber/'>mcabber</a> and I had<br/>
already nuked my IM to the ground before so bitlebee was a bit much.</p>
<p>I had nuked my IM previously because it was just too much to talk with all<br/>
those folks all the time.  I hooked up gchat and was using mcabber mostly to<br/>
talk to the few people who were interested in still talking to me and a few<br/>
potential clients.</p>
<p>Yet, yesterday I realized that for the last month or so I hadn&#8217;t really been<br/>
in a good conversation with most of the people on even this stripped down IM<br/>
setup.  Most of the talk has been me talking to them, and then them ignoring<br/>
me or giving me a one liner.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of a blabber mouth on IM, especially when I&#8217;m bored, so rather than<br/>
torture my friends further by bothering them with queries to go eat lunch, I<br/>
just turned my IM off.  It&#8217;s probably best given my love of talking that I<br/>
just use email to converse with my friends.</p>
<p>So yes, people should go try Bitlbee as it does look cool, but for me, it&#8217;s<br/>
kind of pointless now.  I just don&#8217;t really do IM anymore, and will mostly<br/>
rely on email with a bit of <span class='caps'>IRC</span>.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Looked at CenterICQ instead of mcabber?&#8221;</h3>
<p>I tried <a href='http://thekonst.net/centericq/'>CenterICQ</a> a while back and really<br/>
didn&#8217;t like it.  I don&#8217;t remember my reasons, but I do remember hating all<br/>
the tons of features the thing had and how complex it was.  Mcabber is kind<br/>
of crap, since it has the weirdest key setup and almost no docs, but at<br/>
least it did one thing really well.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Have you tried Sup instead of Mutt?&#8221;</h3>
<p>Yes, I tried <a href='http://sup.rubyforge.org/'>Sup</a> back in the day, and haven&#8217;t<br/>
tried it since.  It seemed pretty cool, but I just didn&#8217;t get back to<br/>
playing with it.</p>
<p>My actual email client is <a href='http://sylpheed.sraoss.jp/en/'>Sylpheed</a>.  I like<br/>
it because it&#8217;s quick, works really well, and has just enough features to do<br/>
what I need.  For example, Sylpheed will actually put my email into folders<br/>
based on simple rules.  Already a big win over Mutt.</p>
<p>I might check out Sup soon though because I do like the idea of going all<br/>
console for my podcasts, news, and email.</p>
<h2>The Actual Point Of The Article</h2>
<p>I know the title of the article makes it seem like I want people to help me<br/>
find the Mutt of feed readers, but the actual point of the article is to say<br/>
I already have.  A secondary purpose is to point out just how fucking dumb<br/>
all the other ones are, and to maybe kick some people in the ass to do<br/>
better.  If I hadn&#8217;t found Newsbeuter I might have written one myself, but<br/>
now I don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>Hopefully people writing these kinds of programs can clean things up or try<br/>
something different.  I doubt they will though since the point of being a<br/>
programmer is assuming everything you write is perfect.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Be That Guy</h2>
<p>I gave a presentation once at RubyConf in Denver that was going to cover<br/>
mathematics, testing, and processes.  I just knew I&#8217;d be screwed because<br/>
there&#8217;s always that guy in the audience who can&#8217;t listen to a presentation<br/>
without running his fucking mouth &#8220;asking&#8221; an endless pseudo-question.  I<br/>
absolutely hate that guy because he&#8217;s so pedantic, and yet so wrong.</p>
<p>In the process of creating my presentation, I invented the term &#8220;That Guy&#8221;.<br/>
In my slides I put mistakes on purpose, and then made fun of That Guy trying<br/>
to correct me.  He of course was focused on the minute tiny details that<br/>
don&#8217;t actually matter in a 40 minute presentation, instead of focusing on<br/>
the important part of the ideas.</p>
<p>Later in the conference, Tim Bray got attacked by That Guy.  He said that<br/>
you can&#8217;t reliably sort Unicode alphabetically.  Oh my god, it&#8217;s like he<br/>
said you can&#8217;t add numbers or shit in a toilet.  Every That Guy in the room<br/>
started arguing with him, &#8220;asking&#8221; long fucking questions proposing a<br/>
solution, or just generally being dickheads with their own self-importance.</p>
<p>Just like the people who think Mutt does folders because it can read mail in<br/>
another directory.  Stop being That Guy.  I&#8217;m a pretty smart dude, so if I say Mutt<br/>
doesn&#8217;t do folders, don&#8217;t assume I&#8217;m an idiot.  Assume that either the Mutt<br/>
people didn&#8217;t document the bizarre key sequences required for the feature,<br/>
or that I mean something more complex than your dipshit myopic mind can<br/>
grasp from that one single sentence.</p>
<h2>Thanks For The Advice</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t take this blog entry to mean I don&#8217;t like hearing about new ideas and<br/>
software.  I love having people send me interesting open source projects<br/>
they&#8217;re working on.  So, please shoot me more suggestions.  Just don&#8217;t be<br/>
That Guy.</p></div></content><updated>2008-08-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-08-01.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-07-20.html</id><title type='text'>2008-07-20</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p><a href='http://rubyfringe.com/'>RubyFringe</a> was my <strong>last</strong> Ruby conference and it was<br/>

to find a reader that doesn&#8217;t suck donkey balls has been a chore.</p>
<p>After a long search through the world of open source feed readers, I finally<br/>

blast.</p>
<p>I took the time to go through all the changes between Ruby 1.8.6 p114 and<br/>
Ruby 1.8.6 p230 and analyzed the changes so that you can know what they are<br/>
and how the defects are security defects.</p>
<p>My history with the Ruby guys hiding their shame in patches and never<br/>
admitting that they fucked up important parts of Ruby goes pretty far back.<br/>
I found some pretty bad memory leaks with Mongrel and during that time Ruby<br/>
idiots would claim it was the, &#8220;OS holding the memory, not a leak.&#8221;<br/>
Riiight.  We now know much different, but I&#8217;ve never seen a public admission<br/>

<p><a href='http://www.arabstrap.co.uk/'>Arab Strap is the shit.</a></p></div></content><updated>2008-06-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-06-21.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-06-13.html</id><title type='text'>2008-06-13</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I&#8217;m dropping a large blog post on everyone to just say that I haven&#8217;t died, I&#8217;ve just been <br/>
busy working on my book for <a href='http://www.pearsonhighered.com/'>A/W</a> about Mongrel.<br/>
I had contracted with them to do a book about deploying Mongrel, but then decided it wouldn&#8217;t be<br/>
a very good book since <a href='http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321483502'>we&#8217;d already done one about that<br/>
topic</a> and there<br/>
wasn&#8217;t too much more to say.</p>
<p>Well the book is now about how I wrote Mongrel, kind of teaching you about<br/>
writing a network server in Ruby and C but doing it by teaching you about<br/>
Mongrel.  The first part of the book is going slow, so I&#8217;ve had to hide out<br/>
and not answer much email.  It&#8217;s still murder writing a book like this<br/>
though because I have to write it fast to meet a deadline.  The book will<br/>
cover things like writing parsers, efficient network code, <span class='caps'>HTTP</span> the<br/>
protocol, Ruby&#8217;s sockets, Event based programming, and even how Mongrel&#8217;s<br/>
parser is used in other languages and servers.</p>
<p>You can think of it as &#8220;Zed&#8217;s Last Book of Ruby Tricks&#8221;.  After that I&#8217;ll be<br/>
working on my &#8220;Protocols and Performance&#8221; book which will be a more expanded<br/>
and serious version of the same topic, not focused on Ruby.</p>
<h2>Conferences</h2>
<p>At the same time however I need to go to at least two more conferences.  One<br/>
I just finished was <a href='http://2008.rubyenrails.nl/'>Ruby En Rails 2008</a> which<br/>
was a blast to attend.  Amsterdam is a fantastic city, there was tons of<br/>
great people and man do they have a bunch of software shops popping up<br/>
there.  I think they have the hottest Rails market in Europe based on my<br/>
limited experience.  I&#8217;m glad they invited me too.</p>
<p>You can <a href='/repository/rubyenrails2008/build/rubyenrails_2008.pdf'>check out my presentation</a> which<br/>
was funny, but according to <a href='http://twitter.com/obie'>Obie</a> very pointless.</p>
<p>I also met the <a href='http://www.modrails.com/'>Phusion Passenger</a> guys and holy<br/>
fucking crap are they on to something.  If anyone is going to actually take<br/>
on Mongrel in the hosting area it&#8217;s Passenger.  The developers are super<br/>
cool nice guys (unlike me) and even <span class='caps'>DHH</span> likes their stuff.  He really never<br/>
liked anything I built, so hopefully those guys get more support.  About the<br/>
only thing keeping them from taking over is that they use forking so a few<br/>
libraries that keep resources open will have serious problems.  They&#8217;ll<br/>
probably have to think up some kind of thing for that soon, but I think most<br/>
Rails deployments could get pretty far with Passenger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class='caps'>UPDATE</span>:</strong>  Hongli says: &#8220;Actually this has already been solved. 2 months<br/>
ago, to be exact &#8211; before Phusion Passenger was released. :) Some libraries<br/>
keep resources open, yes, but the only things that we have to worry about<br/>
are open file descriptors. We used to close file descriptors upon forking,<br/>
based on a black list of file descriptors to close, but we quickly found out<br/>
that that doesn&#8217;t work very well and easily resulted in file descriptor<br/>
leaks. So now we close all file descriptors, except those that are specified<br/>
in a white list (i.e. stdin, stdout, stderr and a few others).  Everything<br/>
has been working flawlessly since then.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For years everyone has tried to &#8220;beat mongrel&#8221; but just couldn&#8217;t pull it<br/>
off.  I personally wouldn&#8217;t care much since developers should use the best<br/>
tool out there, but man the people trying to unseat Mongrel just suck at it.<br/>
My favorite was how <a href='http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/09/end-is-near-for-mongrel.html'>Charles declared Mongrel<br/>
dead</a> in<br/>
2007.  I grabbed it and tried to upload an image when it crashed with a<br/>
out-of-memory error.  It took them like nine months to fix that shit.<br/>
Here&#8217;s a clue, before you try to compete with someone who makes no money on<br/>
their software and actually doesn&#8217;t work on it very much, at a bare minimum<br/>
try to get the fucking protocol to allow an upload.  Things might work<br/>
better for you then.</p>
<p>Honestly though, it shouldn&#8217;t be that hard to beat Mongrel since Mongrel is<br/>
crippled by Ruby.  What the Phusion guys are pulling off is just using<br/>
Apache to do the heavy lifting and then let their module do the work to<br/>
stream out to Rails.  It&#8217;s not a new idea, they&#8217;re just doing a great job<br/>
marketing it and educating people while keeping things simple.  The kicker<br/>
is that they also have support for Rack and <strong><span class='caps'>WSGI</span></strong>.  Now that&#8217;s fucking<br/>
sexy.</p>
<p>What is very new about Passenger is that even though it does forking, Hongli<br/>
managed to clean up much of Ruby&#8217;s memory management so that each fork is<br/>
small and clean.  This should greatly reduce your memory footprint, I think<br/>
an estimated 15-30%.</p>
<h2>Announcing EaRing</h2>
<p>There was also working software which came out of my talk that you might<br/>
like to try.  It&#8217;s called <a href='/projects/earing'>EaRing</a>, and it&#8217;s the perfect accessory to<br/>
every Ruby company.  EaRing is a weirdo assembly language that&#8217;s almost like a<br/>
scripting language.  You hand it a sane assembler script and it<br/>
compiles it on the fly and runs it.  It&#8217;s fast and very dynamic and probably<br/>
won&#8217;t work on any computer you have.  Still, you can grab it from the<br/>
<a href='/projects/earing'>EaRing project page</a> and you can grab the source with <br/>
<em>bzr branch http://zedshaw.com/repository/earing/</em>.  I wrote it quickly in my<br/>
spare time during the two weeks before the conference, so it&#8217;s not the<br/>
greatest code ever.</p>
<h2>My Last Ruby Conference</h2>
<p>The next conference, and sadly my last Ruby conference will be <br/>
<a href='http://rubyfringe.com/'>Ruby Fringe</a> in Toronto.  This conference was<br/>
apparently <a href='http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/06/rubyfringe-08'>made in my honor/image</a><br/>
and should prove to be pretty damn great, if it doesn&#8217;t get all the <br/>
organizers and speakers passively aggressively killed by Chad Fowler.</p>
<p>Why is RubyFringe my last <strong>Ruby</strong> conference?  Well my friends, I honestly<br/>
don&#8217;t know why Ruby conferences keep inviting me.  I ripped on tons of<br/>
people and basically called everyone a bunch of ghetto fab whores.  Of<br/>
course I only meant the small percentage of people and the companies that<br/>
are fucking up Ruby, but I said it and then walked away to go work on<br/>
something else for a while.  I figured that&#8217;d be it and then I could get<br/>
back to more fun things.</p>
<p>Instead, I apparently said what a lot of programmers stuck at the bottom<br/>
wanted to say but didn&#8217;t have the courage.  I think now they look at me as<br/>
the guy who can possibly call bullshit on all the goings on in the Ruby<br/>
world, but honestly I&#8217;m not really that powerful.  I basically have a huge<br/>
nasty mouth and very little fear of reprisal.  There&#8217;s nothing I can do to<br/>
change the way things work, all I can do is write about how I feel about the<br/>
industry and hope that some of the ideas sink in to the next batch of<br/>
programmers.</p>
<p>The number of times I hear &#8220;Steak and Strippers&#8221; at conferences tells<br/>
me I&#8217;m doing a good job at that through my blog.</p>
<p>If people want things to change, don&#8217;t invite me to a conference, invite<br/>
other people who care about your language and have something new to say.<br/>
One of the reasons I&#8217;m a draw at conferences is I <strong>never</strong> recycle a<br/>
presentation and I try to write software for every single one.  Whether the<br/>
software is the presentation itself in Factor, Python build tools to make<br/>
the presentation, or some nifty hack I wrote, it doesn&#8217;t matter.  I always<br/>
have new software to present on or with.  If you want to keep things solid<br/>
and real at conferences, make this demand of your speakers.  They should not<br/>
recycle talks, and they should present some kind of software.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still going to write about how retarded the whole software industry is,<br/>
and I&#8217;ll attend conferences that have nothing to do with Ruby. I&#8217;ll be at<br/>
DefCon and another conference in Poland, and probably a few others, but none<br/>
that have to do with Ruby.  I&#8217;ll definitely be focusing on the dicks who<br/>
think they&#8217;re at the top of the Ruby community and the companies trying to<br/>
make a buck off the Ruby Proletariat.</p>
<p>But, I can&#8217;t justify going to Ruby conferences anymore.  Sorry.</p>
<h2>My Work At The Bear Is Done</h2>
<p>Some people were wondering what happened at Bear Stearns.  Well, Bear is no<br/>
more.  They were bought out <strong>in a single weekend</strong> by JPMorgan Chase for<br/>
about 2 billion dollars.  The building that Bear owns is worth 1.5 billion.<br/>
Bear had been around for about 80 years, survived the Great Depression,<br/>
World War II, Vietnam, and several market crashes, and was worth 400 billion<br/>
around that time.  To have them evaporate in a weekend is fucking scary as hell.</p>
<p>The dumbest thing is that I held out and waited around in <span class='caps'>NYC</span> to go work at<br/>
Bear.  I had thought, man these fucking start-ups can&#8217;t pay me and flame out<br/>
like crazy.  I think I&#8217;ll go hide out in banking since they never go under.</p>
<p>Wow, that worked out great.  It&#8217;s not really something you can predict, but<br/>
the first day I went to work at Bear they announced their problems with<br/>
subprime mortgages.  The <span class='caps'>CEO</span> lied to everyone and claimed it was only 4% of<br/>
their business, but the truth is &#8220;much greater&#8221; as we found out later.  I&#8217;m<br/>
sure we&#8217;ll never know how much the idiots running Bear actually sunk into<br/>
subprime mortgages, but I&#8217;m thinking it was probably closer to 50% of the<br/>
company or more.</p>
<p>The various start-ups still aren&#8217;t that much better, and companies like<br/>
Microsoft and Google aren&#8217;t very appealing.  So I&#8217;m kind of waiting around<br/>
and just focusing on writing and music now.</p>
<p>Now, what I got out of the deal was a super sweet severance package that<br/>
sets me up for a short time, assuming I can keep my costs low.  The deal to<br/>
buy Bear closed on the 2nd of June, and the second I&#8217;m allowed I&#8217;ll<br/>
spill more details about what everyone got and how it affected me.</p>
<p>If you get a job working at any company related to the financial industry,<br/>
demand twice the market rate for your salary.  Having a company worth close<br/>
to 400 billion dollars die in a weekend is amazing.  There is definitely<br/>
some bad shit going to happen to our economy and I wouldn&#8217;t set foot in a<br/>
finance institution to set the place on fire.</p>
<h2>Rumor Control</h2>
<p><strong><span class='caps'>UPDATE</span>:</strong> Well that was fast.  I originally said Jay Fields was spreading<br/>
this rumor, but Jay says he&#8217;s never said this, although he did say it in<br/>
several jabs at me at the RuPy2008 conference.  I&#8217;ve edited to remove <strong>Jay</strong><br/>
and just replaced it with &#8220;Random ThoughtWorks Asshole&#8221; or <span class='caps'>RTWA</span>.  I&#8217;ll give<br/>
him the benefit of the doubt and assume it&#8217;s just a random ThoughtWorker.</p>
<p>Apparently <span class='caps'>RTWA</span> has been running his/her fat mouth so I think I&#8217;ll include<br/>
a little bit of rumor control.  Although it is kind of funny so I let it<br/>
slide for a while, but now it&#8217;s just dumb.</p>
<p>RTWA&#8217;s been telling people that on the fateful Bear Stearns Ruby on Rails<br/>
project (which ThoughtWorks fucked up) I wrote a text editor and made everyone<br/>
use it.</p>
<p>Alright, now think about this for a second.  First off, I am not that good.<br/>
And, if I did write a text editor in a day (the part he keeps leaving off)<br/>
do you <strong>really</strong> think it&#8217;d be good enough to make people use it?  Also, if<br/>
you know me I&#8217;m <em>dead</em> against making programmers use anything they don&#8217;t<br/>
like.  Why would I make them use a text editor I wrote if they didn&#8217;t like<br/>
it?  Shit I just wrote an assembler for fun and did a whole presentation on<br/>
it to a packed crowd and I still don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good enough.  Right, I&#8217;m<br/>
gonna make people use a fucking editor I wrote.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the real story.  The ThoughtWorkers were insisting on using fucking<br/>
Eclipse for the <span class='caps'>IDE</span> and forcing everyone to use it.  Eclipse is a nasty<br/>
fucking piece of software, but it also meant that nobody learned how a real<br/>
Rails application is laid out because Eclipse&#8217;s only real feature is a hot<br/>
key to find files.  After close to a month of watching programmers fight<br/>
with Eclipse&#8217;s shitty text editor I said we have to find something new.<br/>
Let&#8217;s do a shoot-out.</p>
<p>We tried every fucking editor there was.  We even had a grid on the wall<br/>
with all the features we wanted, and none of them met our goals.  We<br/>
basically wanted Textmate, but we were stuck on Linux so we were screwed.<br/>
Now keep in mind that myself and another programmer were happily using Vim<br/>
and Emacs when nobody was around or cared, and we&#8217;d crank out shitloads of<br/>
great code with them.  I&#8217;m a Vim whore so if I was going to force anyone to<br/>
use an editor it&#8217;d be Vim.  More on that later.</p>
<p>After trying every <span class='caps'>IDE</span>, me and another developer decided to try every editor<br/>
we could find.  We went through about 20, and then I remembered<br/>
<a href='http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/'>J</a> from way back in the day.  J is this<br/>
weird editor that is written in Java, but uses a Common Lisp system the<br/>
author of J wrote to actually write the editor.  Now, the funny thing is J<br/>
is pretty small, but had all the features everyone wanted.</p>
<p>Problem was that J was bitrotted and needed a facelift.  So, I grabbed <br/>
<a href='https://substance.dev.java.net/'>the Substance</a> Swing look and feel, and<br/>
hacked it into the source in about an hour.  I then fixed a few annoying<br/>
bugs, and asked people to try it.  Anyone who liked it just went and used<br/>
it, everyone else suffered with Eclipse.  I even created a Barbie Pink theme<br/>
for one of the female developers to annoy her male arch nemesis.  It was<br/>
kind of fun.</p>
<p>Now, as we&#8217;d hit bugs I&#8217;d do a fix here and there, but really I spent maybe<br/>
a day total working revising an editor that other programmers <strong>willingly</strong> used.<br/>
Later, after everyone had been weened from their Eclipse addiction, people<br/>
asked me to teach them Vim.  Yes, that&#8217;s right, they <strong>asked</strong> me to teach<br/>
them Vim.  I actually didn&#8217;t want to because I wasn&#8217;t sure how it&#8217;d work for<br/>
them, but they all liked it except for a few people who still used J or<br/>
Emacs.  I gave them one class in Vim and they were capable in a few hours.<br/>
I am straight up not lying about that, and I&#8217;m still kind of weirded out by<br/>
it, but that&#8217;s how it went down.</p>
<p>We ended up with some people using Vim, some using J, some using Emacs, and<br/>
then a couple of remote developers who were forced to do lame Citrix were<br/>
forced to use a terminal window through <span class='caps'>SSH</span>.  They tried Vim for a<br/>
while, and I think they eventually used Nano before just giving up and<br/>
hacking on some C# code for the project.   Eclipse is horrible over Citrix.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the difference between my style and the ThoughtWorks style.<br/>
ThoughtWorkers like <span class='caps'>RTWA</span> hear this and think I&#8217;m crazy.  &#8220;You wrote your own<br/>
editor!  <span class='caps'>OMG</span> what about the bus factor?!&#8221;  What they fail to see is that<br/>
everyone got to experience a wide variety of editors and all learned<br/>
something new, eventually deciding they liked Vim.  By the end of the<br/>
project everyone in the room could easily switch between editors and pairing<br/>
wasn&#8217;t a problem at all.  In my style, programmer choice leads to stronger<br/>
programmers because they are exposed to new ideas and ways of doing things.</p>
<p>In the <span class='caps'>RTWA</span> way, they are treated like factory workers or even just<br/>
lowly assembly line widgets that all have to be the same so ThoughtWorks can<br/>
rotate out newly minted trainees and train on the client&#8217;s dime.  Keep that<br/>
in mind when they want to &#8220;standardize&#8221; on a particular programmer tool.<br/>
What you&#8217;re doing is removing any creativity and happiness a programmer<br/>
derives from using her favorite tools.</p>
<p>The irony is, <span class='caps'>RTWA</span>, one of the strongest advocates for everyone using<br/>
the same shitty Eclipse editor, was walking around a conference in Poland<br/>
insulting me claiming I forced people to use an editor I wrote.  Use your<br/>
brain when you hear things like that.  I don&#8217;t have any reason to lie to<br/>
people since I don&#8217;t make any money anyway.  Always remember that I advocate<br/>
programmers being allowed to use their favorite tools, and exposing them to<br/>
new stuff they might not know about.</p>
<p>Another funny thing about the Vim experience:  I also use<br/>
<a href='http://vimperator.mozdev.org/'>Vimperator</a> and <a href='http://awesome.naquadah.org/'>the Awesome Window<br/>
Manager</a> among other fun tools.  I <strong>never</strong><br/>
would force this environment on other people as it is very particular to how<br/>
I work, but they would sit with me and watch me code, then ask me what I was<br/>
using.  I&#8217;d tell them and they&#8217;d go off and install it and then use it<br/>
themselves.  I&#8217;d give them quick training in it, and other people would go<br/>
find similar tools that fit their needs.</p>
<p>Good tools don&#8217;t have to be forced on people.</p>
<h3>And Remember, I&#8217;m An Asshole</h3>
<p>Next, I think he&#8217;ll try to tell you how I ripped into one of their<br/>
consultants, but I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll leave off how all of the ThoughtWorkers<br/>
would constantly bully <strong>my</strong> employee because my guy was making them look bad.  I<br/>
sure as hell ripped into that turd fucking TWer when he started to rant at<br/>
my guy yet again claiming the shitpile they wrote was &#8220;just like the 12 rails<br/>
code bases I have on my laptop&#8221;.  They would constantly lie about how their<br/>
code was just like any other Rails project, which was total unmitigated bullshit.</p>
<p>Him and his TW buddies would constantly pick on my guy (who was 10 times the<br/>
developer they ever could be) mostly because he&#8217;d speak out against their<br/>
idiotic design decisions.  Remember when you&#8217;re in charge that you<br/>
first try to calmly get people to quit doing subversive social bullshit, but<br/>
eventually you have to shut it down any way you can.  That kind of<br/>
psychological torture can drive some people to hurt themselves and can get<br/>
you sued if you let it continue.</p>
<p>What amazed me is everyone was outraged at me telling this guy to fuck off<br/>
with his &#8220;+1 Reputation Healing Laptop-of-12-code-bases&#8221; and shut his<br/>
fucking mouth, but nobody ever jumped on him and his TW buddies for putting up<br/>
signs insulting my guy.  Yes, signs, only about a single employee that worked at<br/>
Bear Stearns, their client.  Nobody who thinks that&#8217;s the correct<br/>
professional behavior for a consultant deserves to be listened to.  It is<br/>
evil, subversive, ruthless bullshit for no reason.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the truth, my guy was a very nice man who had some personal problems<br/>
like we all do at times.  It isn&#8217;t polite for me to go into what he was<br/>
dealing with, but having a bunch of scrub coders try to tear him down daily<br/>
while dealing with all the other bullshit in the company sure as hell wasn&#8217;t<br/>
helping him.  I tried my best to help him out, but it was just a fucked<br/>
situation all around, and I wasn&#8217;t dealing with things very well either.<br/>
About the only thing I could do was keep the TWers from hurting him further<br/>
with their psychological warfare bullshit.</p>
<p>This is the thing they don&#8217;t tell you in business school.  These dumb fuck<br/>
sales tactics and shit like<br/>
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming'><span class='caps'>NLP</span></a> hurt the<br/>
decent and truly fragile people.  The idea that all members of a team must<br/>
be carbon clones removes their identities and forces the individuals who are<br/>
intelligent out of a job for no real benefit to the software process.  If my<br/>
guy had been forced off the team or out of the job I&#8217;m not sure what would<br/>
have happened to him.  He was a very nice man and needed to leave on his own<br/>
power, not forced out.  I considered it my job to keep everyone else<br/>
from pushing him out, even though I knew he wouldn&#8217;t stay very long.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s doing great now at a hot start-up making money, but I still feel very<br/>
bad about how he was treated.  Hopefully me telling people about it will<br/>
make sure that nobody else gets treated poorly by those frat boys pretending<br/>
to be programmers.</p>
<h2>Finally, I Got A Sweet Guitar</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been getting back into practicing my guitar and learning more about<br/>
music.  I kind of stopped for a while, but recently I went out and bought a<br/>
very nice <a href='http://www.schecterguitars.com/spec.asp?id=277'>Schecter</a> with a<br/>
white body.  At first I didn&#8217;t know it was marketed as a great Metal guitar.<br/>
I mostly play Jazz and Blues, but when I played it I loved the way it felt.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even better about this thing is that I got it for $500 off because<br/>
the idiots at Guitar Center didn&#8217;t know that you have to replace the 9volt<br/>
battery in it or the active <span class='caps'>EMG</span> pick-ups don&#8217;t work right.  I was playing<br/>
it, and then did some research, and after I bought it I replaced the battery<br/>
and it was a totally different guitar.  Dumbfucks.</p>
<p>Of course I had to tinker with it and fucked up the tuning something fierce.<br/>
I&#8217;ve never had a guitar with a floating bridge before, so when I went to<br/>
tune it I knocked it all out of alignment.  Took me forever to get that<br/>
thing back, but now it sounds like it did when I bought it.  Very crisp and<br/>
easy to play.</p>
<p>I also bought this incredibly fun Ukulele that is electric/acoustic and has<br/>
six strings.  The two extra strings are sympathetic strings, and the jack<br/>
for the Uke uses sensors to detect the string vibrations translating them<br/>
into sound.  What I do is I run it through my <span class='caps'>POD</span> X3 or various other sound<br/>
modulation systems to make some evil sounding things nobody should listen to<br/>
sober.</p>
<h2>Going Dark For A While</h2>
<p>I have like three rants all piled up in my <span class='caps'>WIP</span> directory ready to go, but I<br/>
want to let them simmer and work on them when I have more space in my head.<br/>
Right now I&#8217;ve got to focus on the book and then after that I&#8217;ll be<br/>
publishing more stuff.</p>
<p>Feel free to email me if you have questions or are using the software on my<br/>
site.  I use most of the stuff here daily so if you track the Bazaar<br/>
repository for each one then you can pull down any changes I make.  I won&#8217;t<br/>
announce them on the blog though, just track them if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>See ya in a few months.</p></div></content><updated>2008-06-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-06-13.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-29.html</id><title type='text'>2008-04-29</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p><strong><span class='caps'>UPDATE</span></strong>: There seems to be some interest in Idiopidae too and I&#8217;ve been<br/>

if you&#8217;re using it.  Due to a slight change in the <strong>forall</strong> command where<br/>
I stopped using raw regex and used the fnmatch instead, the unit tests for<br/>
that command weren&#8217;t actually running.  This meant that bugs found their<br/>
way in and now the latest version of Vellum 0.16 should fix all of that.<br/>
It fixes that and just adds a bunch of documentation really.</p>
<p>Speaking of documentation, I&#8217;m still writing the big<br/>
<a href='/projects/vellum/manual-final.pdf'>Book of Vellum</a> and now have the first<br/>
draft of Appendix A where I do a complete walk through the Vellum<br/>
code.  You&#8217;ll notice that it matches the code I <strong>just</strong> changed two<br/>
minutes ago in the <strong>forall</strong> command.  This is the advantage of<br/>
<a href='/projects/idiopidae/'>Idiopidae</a>.  Simply changing the code and re-running<br/>
the book build gets me everything instantly updated.</p>
<p><a href='/projects/vellum/manual-final.pdf'>Grab the updated copy</a> (still without much editing yet)<br/>
and read through if you haven&#8217;t already.  I&#8217;ve also built this one with<br/>
Emacs colors for all my friends from Reddit and YCombinator News since I <br/>
know all you Lisp whores can&#8217;t stay away from your editor designed for a<br/>
man with 8.5 fingers on each hand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be rotating the color scheme each time I release vellum just to have<br/>
fun with it.</p>
<p>You can install this latest drop of Vellum in all the usual ways, and<br/>
you can also grab from Bazaar:</p>
<ul>
	<li>sudo easy_install zapps pygments idiopidae vellum</li>
	<li>bzr branch http://zedshaw.com/repository/vellum/</li>
	<li><a href='https://launchpad.net/vellum'>Grab From Launchpad</a></li>
	<li><a href='/projects/vellum/vellum-0.16.tar.gz'>Grab From Here</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><span class='caps'>LGPL</span>?</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s also been a few good submissions from some folks with suggestions <br/>
for typesetting improvements, Pygments patches and improvements, Vellum<br/>
bug reports, and the <a href='http://pida.co.uk/'><span class='caps'>PIDA</span></a> project wants to use<br/>
Vellum as their build specification system.  They&#8217;ve asked if I&#8217;d change<br/>
the license to <span class='caps'>LGPL</span> so I thought I&#8217;d toss the question out and see how<br/>
people feel about the licenses.</p>
<p>My main motivation for going with GPLv3 is to prevent the common situation<br/>
where corporations take the work, modify it, and don&#8217;t give it back.  I&#8217;m<br/>
also pretty down on corporations in general these days, so I may even<br/>
consider a dual license of <span class='caps'>BSD</span> for non-profits and GPLv3 for corporations.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on the subject of licenses for Vellum are welcome.</p>
<h2>Bazaar Problems</h2>
<p>If you just updated your Bazaar and you use Paramiko, you&#8217;ll find that<br/>
Bazaar blows up because the Paramiko folks removed a function (in a<br/>
fucking minor version release at at that).  The easiest fix for me was<br/>
to simply remove the offending package and then do:</p>
sudo easy_install paramiko==1.7.2
<p>You can review the bug report <a href='https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/213425'>at their launchpad site</a><br/>

and that it&#8217;s based on one of my first Python projects <strong>and</strong> that <br/>
I wrote what you find below in about 3 days while dorking around on<br/>
Vellum and Idiopidae.  Since I&#8217;m both a Python and LaTeX newb<br/>
please feel free to school me.  Better yet, if you think the<br/>
typesetting sucks, then show me your samples.  See if you can<br/>
beat <a href='/projects/vellum/uv.pdf'>this one</a> sent<br/>
to me by Kashif Rasul.  I still consider what he&#8217;s created<br/>
as the bar to get over.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve gone insane recently because I&#8217;ve been obsessed with making<br/>
the documentation for <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum</a> so great angels will cry<br/>
tears of gold.  I&#8217;m treating it as a practice book for the big book I&#8217;m<br/>
writing for A/W by writing a fully LaTeX typeset <span class='caps'>PDF</span> about Vellum using all<br/>
the tools I&#8217;ve created for more modern literate programming.</p>
<p>The big &#8220;feature&#8221; of the book is <strong>insanely well typeset code with color</strong>.<br/>
The typesetting is so good that everyone I&#8217;ve showed it to seems shocked<br/>
by it.  I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s because they think it&#8217;s ridiculous to<br/>
document such a small project that well, or because it&#8217;s way better than<br/>
many other books.  I&#8217;ll let you people tell me what you think too.</p>
<p>I tried to make it fit what many people use for their editor looks, but<br/>
without making the book hard to read.  This turned out to be easy as<br/>
hell with Idiopidae and <a href='http://pygments.org/'>Pygments</a> and in the<br/>
process I learned quite a lot about TeX and LaTeX.</p>
<p>The <a href='/projects/vellum/manual-final.pdf'>end result is good so far</a>, but<br/>
I&#8217;m looking to improve it even further with:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I had to avoid floats because they would shuffle the code around making it hard<br/>
to talk about it.  Instead I just inject the code right there and fake out a float.<br/>
What I want is to have code which is broken between pages cleaned up so that it <br/>
either has a &#8220;blah continued&#8230;&#8221; marker and/or just jumps to the next page.<br/>
That&#8217;s probably going to be hard as hell so it might have to be a manual decision<br/>
after the whole thing is written and positioned.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;d like smaller snippets to exist in a side float or in a two-column page so you<br/>
can read the code and the discussion of it side-by-side.  I really good example <br/>
of this is the discussion of the grammar for Vellum in &#8220;Appendix A: Parser&#8221;.</li>
	<li>Play more with the boxes and outlines for the code sections to see how their<br/>
status in the prose can be made more or less significant.</li>
	<li>Figure out how to use Bazaar to sequentially version code and then get<br/>
Idiopidae to understand the version to use in a discussion.  This would probably <br/>
fall flat with source code since that just changes, but it would be handy<br/>
for some examples.</li>
	<li>Fix up the Pygments line numbering.  Right now they&#8217;re kind of annoying and<br/>
interfere with the reader&#8217;s ability to cut-paste the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Vellum book is a work in progress, but check out how it looks already<br/>
<a href='/projects/vellum/manual-final.pdf'>in <span class='caps'>PDF</span> form.</a>  Definitely look at <strong>Appendix A</strong><br/>
to see how well the source highlight works using <a href='/projects/idiopidae'>Idiopidae</a><br/>
to snarf in live code from the Vellum source.</p>
<p>Vellum and Idiopidae have made creating the book for Vellum incredibly easy.  I now <br/>
don&#8217;t worry about how the code is included or formatted, and I can access it using <br/>
logical sections.  I just tell Idiopidae the file and section and it makes all the<br/>
moves.  A bit of LaTeX glue to wrap it in something pretty and I&#8217;m off.</p>
<p>I can also do some really interesting things with sample outputs<br/>
and incrementally built source files in the book.  When you write a book about code you<br/>
typically want to start with a simple example of some source file, and then <br/>
build it up to more complex levels as the prose progresses.  Traditionally this meant<br/>
generating a series of individual files each with the slight modifications.  Problem<br/>
is this means maintaining all those little files for just one chapter.</p>
<p>With Idiopidae I can actually put multiple files into one larger file, and put the<br/>
code snippets for the progressive discussion into different sections.  I hadn&#8217;t <br/>
thought of this until I did it yesterday, so I may try to formalize this in<br/>
Idiopidae sometime this weekend.</p>
<p>There are a few things I want to add to Idiopidae which will probably involve a rewrite.<br/>
If you use it, don&#8217;t get too attached to the syntax.  What I&#8217;m thinking is that I&#8217;d like <br/>
a feature to run commands, clean the output up, and then inject that into the book.  I&#8217;d<br/>
also like Idiopidae to keep track of md5sums for all the sections it includes.  If the<br/>
md5sum of a section changes then it&#8217;ll report an error assuming that you have to change<br/>
the text around that section to match the code.  After you change it, there&#8217;ll be a <br/>
command line option to tell Idiopidae to update the md5sums.</p>
<p>I think this &#8220;md5sum tracking&#8221; feature could really help keep books about code in <br/>
sync with the code.  The assumption is, if the code changes, then the prose probably<br/>
has to change as well.</p>
<p>Another feature I want in Idiopidae is to use the Pygments parser of ctags on the<br/>
files so that it can find logical sections based on the already structure source.<br/>
If all you need to do is include a series of functions, then having to sprinkle<br/>
the source with export comments that match the function names is stupid.</p>
<p>As I think about these features though, what I find is a lot of overlap between<br/>
how Idiopidae works at building books and how Vellum automates building anything.<br/>
It might be worth looking at Idiopidae reusing Vellum&#8217;s parser and build engine<br/>
so that you can write a nice little description of all the pieces that come<br/>
together to make a book.  It would be a higher level description of the book<br/>
and designed to also embed Vellum build tasks inside import statements so that<br/>
you can run code and have the output injected.</p>
<p>Check out how the book looks so far (grammar errors and spelling included) and let<br/>
me know what you think.  My plan is to wrap all these little tools up into one nice <br/>
tool that helps programmers write better documentation, or at least helps them<br/>
find someone who can write it without much fuss.</p>
<h2>Knuth On Literate Programming</h2>
<p>The ideas in Idiopidae are <strong>nothing</strong> new, as Donald Knuth has been actively<br/>
promoting <a href='http://www.literateprogramming.com/'>Literate Programming</a><br/>
for over two decades.  The main problem with LP though is its insistence<br/>
on combining the <strong>code</strong> and the <strong>prose</strong> into a single file.  There&#8217;s<br/>
serious technical and social issues with this design choice, but in this<br/>
very good interview with <a href='http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856'>Knuth</a><br/>
he mentions a quote that summarizes things quite well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon Bentley probably hit the nail on the head when he once was asked why<br/>
literate programming hasn&#8217;t taken the whole world by storm. He observed that a<br/>
small percentage of the world&#8217;s population is good at programming, and a small<br/>
percentage is good at writing; apparently I am asking everybody to be in both<br/>
subsets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this doesn&#8217;t cover the absolute hardest technical problem with <br/>
combining code and prose in the same source file:  <strong>syntax escape overload</strong>.</p>
<p>When you use most LP systems you&#8217;re taking the source or two whole languages<br/>
with completely different lexical and semantic meaning, and then trying to<br/>
cram them together.  This means juggling in your head two different <br/>
syntax structures <strong>and</strong> how to merge them together with escape sequences.<br/>
The technical difficulty of this probably borders on an grammar<br/>
that would rival Perl or Ruby&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This is a major technical hurdle for both people implementing such systems<br/>
and for the users.  As an implementer, I have to create a parser or some<br/>
hack that can accurately handle both languages.  I also have to figure out<br/>
how the escape sequences are given to the users, how they can encode <br/>
elements of one language in the other (say for giving constants a bold<br/>
font).  This is a huge task, so no wonder why all the literate tools out<br/>
there also do a shitty job at finally typesetting the resulting<br/>
code.</p>
<p>For the users they have to use their brain in ways that don&#8217;t make sense<br/>
for either a programmer or a writer.  A programmer has to work in terms<br/>
of structure and algorithmics with the hardest problem on many projects<br/>
being finding things of interest.  A writer has to work on the creativity<br/>
of the prose, entertainment, whether it reads so that it makes<br/>
sense, and how best to keep the reader engaged.</p>
<p>When I code I don&#8217;t give a damn if the reader is engaged, I care if he can<br/>
understand what&#8217;s written, but I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;m supposed to entertain<br/>
some dork who&#8217;s paid to know this stuff.</p>
<p>These flaws then extend to every other aspect of computer science.  When<br/>
people do LP they typically keep all the code and prose in one giant file,<br/>
maybe a few medium sized ones if you&#8217;re lucky.  This is a nightmare for<br/>
revision control since people on a team will constantly be conflicting<br/>
with other team members.  This makes it hard to break out the work, share<br/>
it with others, hell even find where something is in the source.</p>
<p>Can you imagine trying to grep for a normal C idiom but having to modify<br/>
what you look for to handle TeX escaping just in case it shows up in<br/>
a spot that&#8217;s inside TeX?</p>
<p>In the end, LP seems to have missed out on the biggest advancement in<br/>
software development since it started:  compilers.  A compiler no longer<br/>
expects you to keep your source in one file, but instead has insanely<br/>
good (or in C&#8217;s case, okey-dokey) support for inclusion, exporting,<br/>
combination, and sharing of code.  Modularity and encapsulation into<br/>
libraries, modules, objects, and functions has all been supported by<br/>
compilers since they started being used to create larger projects.</p>
<p>Yet, LP almost misses this and does an &#8220;inverse compiler&#8221;  You write<br/>
the final combined document and then it writes what you&#8217;d normally<br/>
include in the document.  Insane.</p>
<p>It makes much more sense and works a hell of a lot better with<br/>
modern tools (&#8220;modern&#8221; being after 1980) if the way programmers<br/>
do Literate Programming works the way they do regular programming.</p>
<p>But, TeX is still pretty damn sweet.</p></div></content><updated>2008-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-26.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-18.html</id><title type='text'>2008-04-18</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>While working on a more complex build I decided to make recursive<br/>

<p>Now, your imports are more explicit (just the way Python people like it) and<br/>
more consistent:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>

</blockquote>
<p>This is the import stanza from Vellum&#8217;s <em>build.vel</em><br/>
file.  What you see is there&#8217;s two type of things<br/>
you can import, recipes and modules.  Recipes are<br/>
just other Vellum scripts that contain common <br/>
tasks you need.  Modules are Python modules that<br/>
have code you need in the form of commands.</p>
<p>I pushed the version of Vellum that has this<br/>
as version 0.14-rev85 so it&#8217;s on the Cheese Shop<br/>
and in the bzr and launchpad.  I would avoid it<br/>
right now unless you&#8217;re interested in the latest<br/>
code as it currently doesn&#8217;t load from the <br/>
~/.vellum/ directory yet so your common stuff<br/>
will break.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do another release later today that brings that<br/>
back.</p>
<h2>Python Is My <em>make</em></h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve finally figured out a <strong>huge</strong> difference between<br/>
what I&#8217;m doing with Vellum and what <em>make</em> does that<br/>
turns certain types of programmers off from Vellum.</p>
<p>When you work with a compiled programming language<br/>
like Java, C, or C++ the build tool is an essential<br/>
part of your daily working.  You can&#8217;t do<br/>
anything without <em>make</em> happily building and compiling<br/>
your software so you can run it.</p>
<p>Without <em>make</em> you can&#8217;t test, run, analyze, debug,<br/>
or do anything.  The entire chain of build junk <br/>
in a compiled language is useless until you follow<br/>
a large number of steps to finally produce an <br/>
executable.  Even if you have just one .c file<br/>
you still need one additional compile step before<br/>
you can run it.</p>
<p>(<span class='caps'>NOTE</span>:  Although <a href='http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/tickc/'>tcc</a><br/>
 makes this possible, very few C coders use it.)</p>
<p>Another necessity is autotools.  Without autoconf<br/>
and friends you can&#8217;t build your software on<br/>
multiple systems and still use advanced features.<br/>
This makes autotools another essential thing, but<br/>
only if you use a language like C that has <br/>
portability problems.</p>
<p>In a dynamic language like Python or Ruby I<br/>
don&#8217;t have this problem at all.  There is no<br/>
need for a <em>make</em> to run my program.  I just<br/>
run it.  The interpreter is my <em>make</em> and does<br/>
all the stuff I need to make the code I <br/>
wrote work.  I only violate this when I<br/>
write a C extension, and even then both languages<br/>
have tools that help me do that consistently.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need complex steps, or linkers, or loaders<br/>
or <a href='http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/04/gold-google-releases-new-and-improved.html'>gold from Google</a><br/>
to happily work all day long.  I don&#8217;t need things<br/>
like autoconf because Python is portable unless I&#8217;m<br/>
writing C extensions, and even then ctypes lets me<br/>
avoid a lot of that for quite a while.</p>
<p>When I code, I need to run unit tests, but even that<br/>
is handled for me by <a href='http://www.somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/'>nose</a> so there&#8217;s not much for<br/>
me to do manually.  I don&#8217;t have a build phase,<br/>
I don&#8217;t have build errors, I just have code that<br/>
runs or doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I can even use Python as a debugger, a console, the<br/>
works.  I don&#8217;t need fancy builders and test harnesses<br/>
just to see if a few lines of code work.  With a compiled<br/>
language I&#8217;ve had to create entire Makefile or Ant builds<br/>
taking hours <strong>just to try one idea</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In essence, for programmers using compiled languages <em>make</em> is their Python.</strong></p>
<p>For Python programmers, <em>make</em> is nothing more than a<br/>
complicated if-statement with lots of magic.</p>
<p>This is why, when I wrote Vellum, it didn&#8217;t really need<br/>
to know how to handle the build junk of a .c file.<br/>
Vellum is higher level than this because Python already<br/>
does all the crap that <em>make</em> does.  What I needed was a<br/>
tool to help automate the things Python doesn&#8217;t do like<br/>
packaging, distribution, test automation, bzr management,<br/>
and code generation.</p>
<p>To a programmer who&#8217;s entire life belongs to <em>make</em> this<br/>
seems retarded.  On the surface it seems so deficient<br/>
because it can&#8217;t automagically figure out that depending<br/>
on a .o file means to obviously build a .c file (unless<br/>
it&#8217;s .c++, or .cpp, or .C, or .d) using cc (or<br/>
gcc, or g++, or &#8230;).</p>
<p>Vellum obviously can do those things, assuming someone<br/>
decides to write the commands needed for such magic,<br/>
but why bother?  I don&#8217;t do much with those languages<br/>
these days, and when I do, why I&#8217;ll just write the<br/>
bare minimum <em>make</em> necessary to build the C code and<br/>
then have Vellum run that.</p>
<p>No point re-inventing 30 years of mythological C building<br/>
lore just to keep a bunch of people happy who spend 50%<br/>
of their day waiting for a program to make their program<br/>
executable.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve found is that people who use <em>make</em> are very<br/>
focused on how they can use Vellum to do what <em>make</em><br/>
already does.  What they miss is that Vellum, unlike<br/>
make, can be extended with Python to do anything you<br/>
need.</p></div></content><updated>2008-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-18.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-15.html</id><title type='text'>2008-04-15</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I worked on <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum</a> today after waking up from jetlag and Poland.  I feel<br/>
like it&#8217;s near ready for actual use by people.  I even managed to polish<br/>
it off with a nice little command line option for dumping the commands<br/>
a build spec uses including their documentation.  Check out <br/>
<a href='http://pastie.caboo.se/181564'>this Pastie clip</a> that shows it off.</p>
<p>What you see here is first the vellum/commands.py file with the commands<br/>
that you can use.  This file is actually loaded the same way your own<br/>
commands could be loaded, by just saying what to import as a regular<br/>
Python module.  What Vellum does is look in this file for anything<br/>
that is a function and then makes those into commands.</p>
<p>Next is the actual build.vel file that makes those commands active in<br/>
the <strong>modules</strong> section.</p>
<p>Now, the nice part is right after that you see the results of the <em>vellum -C</em><br/>
command line option.  It literally just pulls out the documentation for<br/>
each function and prints it as the command&#8217;s documentation.  If you give<br/>
-C any command names it just prints those out.</p>
<p>This means you can write Python functions for commands you want, then<br/>
put them in a module in ~/.vellum/modules or even just make a regular<br/>
Python project out of them and install in the normal way.  Once<br/>
you do that you can use those in your build specs.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href='/projects/vellum/'>project page</a> for information<br/>
on getting this and using it.  I&#8217;ll have more extensive documentation<br/>
on it soon.</p>
<h2>620 Lines Of Python</h2>
<p>Using this awesome <a href='http://cloc.sourceforge.net/'><span class='caps'>CLOC</span></a> program I figured<br/>
out that Vellum is only 733 lines of code, but 620 if you take out the <br/>
parser.py file generated from parser.g.  That&#8217;s pretty fucking amazing <br/>
considering all the shit this thing can do already.</p>
<p>Think about this for a second:  In less than a month I managed to create<br/>
a build tool that parses it&#8217;s own build format with dynamic scoped<br/>
imports, loads additional Python modules to give you a command structure,<br/>
and then runs arbitrarily sized shell or Python code according to<br/>
the dependency structure.  It&#8217;s also got a decent test suite, is fully<br/>
self-documenting, and has comments on almost every function.</p>
<p>That says a lot for Python.  Combine my efficiency working on Vellum with<br/>
how quickly I cranked out <a href='/projects/idiopidae/'>Idiopidae</a> and Python<br/>
is really proving itself as a great workhorse language.</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed the interplay between people who wanted a Python<br/>
only syntax and those who liked <span class='caps'>YAML</span> syntax.  What I got out of that<br/>
exchange was what I consider a very nice setup for Vellum where users<br/>
have a nice simple format for the build file that&#8217;s high-level, but<br/>
can easily write new commands in regular Python modules for more<br/>
complex work.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I could have made that leap if it weren&#8217;t for the people<br/>
who were talking to me about the benefits of both needs.</p>
<p>Next up for Vellum is a more extensive set of documentation for it<br/>
so everyone else can learn to use it, and then a way to distribute<br/>
recipes.  I&#8217;ll probably use the <a href='http://launchpad.net/vellum'>Launchpad<br/>
project</a> for the recipes.</p>

I corrected the URLs but just<br/>
wait until tonight when I drop another release with some goodies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still in Poland enjoying <a href='http://rupy.eu/'>RuPy 2008</a> but thought<br/>
I&#8217;d put out a release of <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum</a> 0.11 for people to play with.</p>
<p>You can grab it from <a href='http://launchpad.net/vellum/'>launchpad</a> where<br/>
you can get the bzr repo and download source tarballs.</p>
<p>You can also easy_install it, but this is new so let me know if it works.<br/>
You should just have to do:</p>
easy_install vellum
<p>Finally, if you want the bleeding edge Vellum then track my bzr repo:</p>
bzr branch http://zedshaw.com/repository/vellum/
<p>Now, what&#8217;s in this release?  It basically has all the features I want<br/>
but isn&#8217;t well documented.  There&#8217;s extensive tests and docstrings on<br/>
every method, so a brave programmer could figure it out.  For the<br/>
most part the <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum project page</a> has samples<br/>
of the new Vellum format, and there&#8217;s sample commands in the <br/>
vellum/commands.py file in the source.</p>
<p>What you get in this release is the ability to write new commands for<br/>
your build spec in pure python, plus tons of little clean-ups and<br/>
bug fixes.</p>
<p>Try it out, and let me know if you can get it working.  I&#8217;ll be writing<br/>
a short manual for it pretty soon.</p>
<h2>My RuPy Presentation In Bazaar</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m putting up the full Bazaar repository for my RuPy presentation<br/>
so other people can grab it and play with it.  This presentation was<br/>
done using all my tools. <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum</a> for building <br/>
it.  <a href='/projects/zapps/'>Zapps</a> for Vellum.  <a href='/projects/idiopidae/'>Idiopidae</a><br/>
for code injection into the presentation.</p>
<p>The presentation was done using <a href='http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/'>LaTeX Beamer</a><br/>
to make <a href='/projects/rupy2008/presentation.pdf'>this <span class='caps'>PDF</span> presentation</a><br/>
which was actually generated from <a href='/projects/rupy2008/frames.yml'>this <span class='caps'>YAML</span> file</a><br/>
using a small <a href='/projects/rupy2008/scripts/yml2beamer.py'>Python script I wrote</a><br/>
to generate the necessary (and repetitive) LaTeX.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be cleaning this up and writing about it when I write about RuPy<br/>
sometime next week.  So far RuPy has been a blast and I really like<br/>
Poznan.  Virgin Atlantic and Heathrow Airport however can die in the ocean.</p></div></content><updated>2008-04-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-13.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-09.html</id><title type='text'>2008-04-09</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Well, well, well.  <a href='http://code.google.com/appengine/'>Google comes out with their App Engine thing</a> and<br/>
what do you know, they use <span class='caps'>YAML</span> for their application descriptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see <strong>any</strong> Pythonistas complaining about it publicly.<br/>
Imagine that.</p>
<p>See, that pisses me off because several people said nobody would adopt<br/>
a project if it didn&#8217;t use Python from stem to stern.  I personally think<br/>
if you can&#8217;t think in a few languages on a project then your a dumbass, but<br/>
I obliged folks and wrote a Python parser for Vellum&#8217;s builds.</p>
<p>Then people said they didn&#8217;t like <strong>that</strong> format either.</p>
<p>This folks is the classic problem with programmers today.  They absolutely<br/>
refuse to learn anything new unless they can see that learning the new<br/>
hotness will give them an immediate 200% boost in salary or get them hot<br/>
honeys at the next conference.</p>
<p>I use a <span class='caps'>YAML</span> format for a build file and it&#8217;s not good enough.  I write a<br/>
Python one and it&#8217;s <strong>still</strong> not good enough.</p>
<p>Google uses <span class='caps'>YAML</span> and people can&#8217;t wait to blow Eric in the back bathroom<br/>
as thanks for using Python.</p>
<p>Well, since that&#8217;s the case I&#8217;ve decided to just write my own damn format<br/>
for Vellum.  And it&#8217;s got strippers, and blackjack, and uh fewer symbols<br/>
to deal with, and less typing.  Wait, screw the strippers and blackjack, <br/>
how about just less typing?  Awesome.  Since I can write a parser in about<br/>
an hour I just did it.  So there.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, Vellum just has its own syntax.  It&#8217;s obvious Pythonistas<br/>
<strong>can</strong> learn a new format when it&#8217;s tied to the handle of a massive pot of<br/>
gold.  My format is even cooler than <span class='caps'>YAML</span> or Python, will give you a<br/>
300% boost in salary, <strong>and</strong> will eventually hand mold a Jenna Jameson<br/>
Real Doll&#8482; for you since you can&#8217;t get hot honeys no matter what<br/>
language you learn.</p>
<p>Check out this abreviated grammar for the <strong>whole</strong> data format:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
rule input: ( reference | COMMENT LINE)* ENDMARKER 
rule expr: atom | reference | structure
rule reference: NAME expr 
rule atom: NUMBER  | STRING  | SH LINE 
rule structure: LSQB elements? RSQB  | LPAR dictmaker? RPAR 
rule elements: (expr)+ 
rule dictmaker: (reference)+ 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s right!  My format is only 7 productions and it can produce the same<br/>
structures Python and <span class='caps'>YAML</span> can (minus retarded shit like references).  <br/>
Take a look at the <a href='/projects/vellum/'>sample</a> now and bask in my skills<br/>
as the format makes you calm and clean.  I was definitely channeling <span class='caps'>REBOL</span><br/>
on this one.</p>
<p>And this only took me like 3 hours to craft and make Vellum use again<br/>
(thank god for tests).  That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;ve changed formats for the Vellum<br/>
build file 4 times and I&#8217;ve written two parsers for it and I&#8217;m having fun<br/>
so fuck you all. (sniff).</p>
<h2>All Kidding Aside, <span class='caps'>GAE</span> Is The Shit</h2>
<p>Alright, I actually think it&#8217;s hilarious that Google came out with their<br/>
stuff just a few weeks after PyCon2008 and didn&#8217;t seem to clue in any of the<br/>
web framework developers.  I was hanging out with the Turbo Gears and<br/>
Pylons guys for most of PyCon2008 and they didn&#8217;t mention anything.  I<br/>
wonder how they feel about that?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be a little pissed, but just for a few seconds before I started<br/>
counting my mountains of cash cause <strong>Python is gonna be hot!</strong><br/>
I&#8217;ve already got two or three learning applications lined up and I&#8217;m<br/>
even thinking of a slick little script to make cranking out simple<br/>
<span class='caps'>GAE</span> applications easier.</p>
<p>Yes, <span class='caps'>GAE</span> is incredibly cool and I&#8217;m am <strong>so</strong> glad I jumped on the Python<br/>
trail just before they released it.  I can now take my new found fancy<br/>
Python learnin&#8217; and go do some real programming for a change.  I don&#8217;t<br/>
have an account because Google is a stingy bastard, but who cares.  I can<br/>
actually download their whole <span class='caps'>SDK</span> and have fun tinkering on it.  By the<br/>
time I get done making something to share they should be open for<br/>
business.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m very impressed with is the deployment mechanism.  After working<br/>
on Mongrel for years and watching all the hosting companies barely make<br/>
any headway with Ruby, it is so nice to see someone get it right.  Just<br/>
set it and forget it.  None of this binding together 6 shitty services<br/>
with duct tape like you do with AmazonWS.</p>
<h2>Echo2 &#8594; Campfire &#8594; HuddleChat &#8594; Utu</h2>
<p>Everyone seems to like 37signals&#8217; <a href='http://www.campfirenow.com/'>Campfire</a><br/>
so much they came out swinging with <a href='http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/080408-123318'>claims of a ripoff from Google&#8217;s<br/>
HuddleChat.</a></p>
<p>Well, silly boys and girls, rails-core ripped off the idea and probably<br/>
most of the workings for Campfire from <a href='http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/080408-123318'>NextApp Echo2 ChatClient<br/>
Demo.</a>  I know this<br/>
because I was in the rails-core <span class='caps'>IRC</span> channel and I showed them how cool<br/>
this Echo2 framework was, including that chat demo.  A few weeks later they<br/>
had Campfire and since they say it took them two weeks to write it, I&#8217;m<br/>
guessing they got lots of inspiration.</p>
<p>Sure, they probably won&#8217;t admit that, since they&#8217;re &#8220;innovators&#8221; you know, <br/>
but it&#8217;s a really odd coincidence.</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe they were working on Campfire all along and they<br/>
just used their psionic telepathy to will that I go find the Echo2 Chat<br/>
demo and paste it into their <span class='caps'>IRC</span>.  Or, maybe I just remember it<br/>
differently, who knows.  My brain don&#8217;t work that well anyway.</p>
<p>However, there is a precedence.  They also admitted stealing the mechanism<br/>
for updating two divs at the same time from one Ajax call from the <a href='http://www.nitroproject.org/'>Nitro<br/>
project.</a> At the time this was the biggest<br/>
barrier for things like <span class='caps'>RJS</span> to work, and rather than figure it out<br/>
themselves they stole it from poor George and never gave him credit.</p>
<p>Sure this simple Echo2 demo is a pale pathetic competitor to the glorious<br/>
Campfire, but it also is just a demo that hasn&#8217;t changed in years.  I<br/>
actually dump it on Java application servers when I need to do some simple<br/>
chat with people.  It&#8217;s pretty damn useful, so I can see why 37s would <br/>
take the time to rip it off.</p>
<p>Now, I will <strong>gladly</strong> admit that <em>My Time With The Rails Core Cult</em> was <br/>
a major inspiration for the creation of<br/>
<a href='http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/'>Utu</a> and that their Campfire<br/>
actually did make me hate stupid people so much that I felt I needed to<br/>
create a weapon of destruction for weeding them out.  Probably the reason<br/>
I haven&#8217;t worked on Utu in a while is that I stopped hanging out with the<br/>
Ruby dickheads so I&#8217;m not so inclined to hate the flesh of all who type<br/>
&#8220;fuck you&#8221; at me.</p>
<p>Therefor, I&#8217;ll freely admit that rails-core, you guys inspired me to find<br/>
new ways to hate people over chat.  Thank you.</p></div></content><updated>2008-04-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-09.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-05.html</id><title type='text'>2008-04-05</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Latest Vellum (0.8) is out <strong>without</strong> <span class='caps'>YAML</span> and <strong>with</strong> Python but<br/>
also without all of Python.  The motto for this release is:</p>
You love your Python, but I don&#8217;t trust your Python.
<p>What this means is that Vellum now uses a simple small parser<br/>
written with <a href='/projects/zapps'>Zapps</a> (you need that to install<br/>
this release for now) that parses only enough real Python<br/>
to describe a build.</p>
<p>This amounts to import statements, simple assignments, <br/>
full strings, numbers, dicts, lists, tuples, and that&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>Since now the imports work by loading other build files<br/>
recursively it will also find builds using . notation<br/>
<strong>and</strong> pull them out of a ~/.vellum directory so you can<br/>
have common build stuff available.</p>
<p>This release is still rough, with me cleaning up code that<br/>
and I still need to implement the commands you can use,<br/>
but otherwise try it out if you&#8217;re tracking the project.</p>
<p>You can get a release from <a href='https://launchpad.net/vellum/+download'>Launchpad</a><br/>
or from <a href='/projects/vellum/vellum-0.8.tar.gz'>here</a> and<br/>
the Bazaar repo is still up at &#8220;http://www.zedshaw.com/repository/vellum/&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in how the parser works, take a look<br/>
at the vellum/parser.g file.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have another release shortly to clean things up.</p></div></content><updated>2008-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-05.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-01.html</id><title type='text'>2008-04-01</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I blame <em>Rage Against The Machine</em> for today&#8217;s distraction and productivity.<br/>
Between doing tons of chores and crap I managed to cram in <strong>three</strong> releases<br/>
of <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum</a> giving it pretty big feature improvements while keeping the total<br/>
code below 300 lines of Python.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum project</a> here, but I also setup a <br/>
<a href='https://launchpad.net/'>Launchpad</a> project at <a href='https://launchpad.net/vellum'>https://launchpad.net/vellum</a><br/>
for people to collaborate on the project with me.  There you can <a href='https://launchpad.net/vellum/+download'>download</a><br/>
the latest, <a href='https://bugs.launchpad.net/vellum/'>report bugs</a>, and get at the <br/>
<a href='https://code.launchpad.net/vellum/'>latest code</a> via <a href='http://bazaar-vcs.org/'>Baazar</a> if you<br/>
can&#8217;t hit <a href='/repository/vellum/'>my bzr repository</a></p>
<p>The big changes that this release gives you is what I call &#8220;Strings in<br/>
Python Clothes&#8221; where you can write a Python based build description, and<br/>
rather than using the &lt;&lt;&lt;, &lt;&#8212;, or &gt;&gt;&gt; syntax you can use functions<br/>
of sh(), log(), given(), target(), and py().</p>
<p>All these functions do is return what you give them formatted into what<br/>
Vellum wants for a build target description, but this seems to be a <strong>huge</strong><br/>
sticking point for Pythonistas.  I mean, seriously I haven&#8217;t seen such a<br/>
myopic dependence on arbitrary lexical elements since working with Java<br/>
and C# guys.  I actually received emails from people saying that if it<br/>
didn&#8217;t have sh() and array syntax that nobody in Python would use it.</p>
<p>What I did like though was that everyone who disagreed with this syntax<br/>
took the time to explain why and help me understand the culture of Python.<br/>
I don&#8217;t agree with this attitude at all, being a language pragmatist and<br/>
all, but I can understand it so I&#8217;ll help people out.</p>
<p>If you have insight into this weird obsession with everything being always<br/>
in Python no matter what I&#8217;d love to hear it.  From my perspective this is<br/>
why so many programmers are incapable of keeping up with trends.  This <br/>
refusal to learn another language (or anything really) and<br/>
the strange belief that an <span class='caps'>IDE</span> will make you a better programmer (my two<br/>
favorite stupidities) means<br/>
that they stay slaves to what they have now and can&#8217;t formulate a<br/>
perspective about what is possible.</p>
<p>For example, Vellum doesn&#8217;t require <span class='caps'>YAML</span> at all, and it just uses<br/>
<a href='http://pyyaml.org/'>PyYAML</a><br/>
which is pure Python.  Yet, other people seem to think PyYAML needs Syck, <br/>
requires C, and other <span class='caps'>FUD</span> they learned about two years ago.  Each person<br/>
had to be told (several times) that PyYAML was good for the task and they<br/>
were wrong.  This still lead to complaints about YAML&#8217;s syntax, even<br/>
though it&#8217;s nearly the same, and then even though I pointed out they can<br/>
do Python, the Python build syntax <strong>still</strong> wasn&#8217;t Python enough.</p>
<p>What they don&#8217;t realize is that there&#8217;s a <strong>reason</strong> I want <span class='caps'>YAML</span>:  it&#8217;s not<br/>
executable.  This is a <strong>huge</strong> deal when you want to distribute builds to<br/>
other people but still want to keep things safer (notice I said <strong>safer</strong><br/>
not <em>safe</em>).  Being able to grab a <span class='caps'>YAML</span> description of the build and load<br/>
it in dry-run mode with a guarantee that nothing will be run at all helps<br/>
people who need to do automation of other projects.</p>
<p>Imagine this, with Vellum as it is you could start building other people&#8217;s<br/>
projects, but before you do have it dry run and save that build output.  The next<br/>
time you build, do a diff on the dry-run.  If the dry-run changes then<br/>
don&#8217;t do it automatically, but require a human to approve it.  With a<br/>
simple diff of the previous build and the current build process you can<br/>
trivially spot changes in the build process.</p>
<p>However, Python build descriptions can&#8217;t do this because they are Turing<br/>
complete and a victim of the Halting Problem.  In order to find out if the<br/>
Python script could cause damage you&#8217;d have to solve this theoretically<br/>
impossible to solve problem.</p>
<p>Alright, so why include Python build descriptions as an alternative?  Because<br/>
there&#8217;s some things that <strong>can&#8217;t</strong> be described with <span class='caps'>YAML</span>.  Things like a<br/>
configuration script that analyzes the machine for the remaining build<br/>
process.  In this case, having a small config.py that gets imported into<br/>
the larger build.yml solves the problem.</p>
<p>But also, it was trivial to add both and get the best of both worlds.<br/>
People comfortable with <span class='caps'>YAML</span> or who need safer builds can use <span class='caps'>YAML</span>.<br/>
People who hate <span class='caps'>YAML</span> and need Python everywhere to be happy can use Python<br/>
only builds.  People who are pragmatic and want to just use whatever works<br/>
best for the job can use both (like I do).</p>
<p>Everybody is happy hacking friends and Vellum is still small with a<br/>
powerful punch.</p></div></content><updated>2008-04-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-04-01.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-31.html</id><title type='text'>2008-03-31</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Just a quick announcement that I&#8217;ve managed to get <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum</a> nearly close<br/>
to what I need for building all my stuff.  It has been refactored to be<br/>
funnier and also includes a simple &#8220;import&#8221; system that implements an idea<br/>
of recipes.  The recipes are still rough, but do work by taking the <br/>
contents of another .yml (<span class='caps'>YAML</span>) file and putting those contents into the<br/>
master with a namespace.</p>
<p>Vellum also has a fairly complete unit test suite that exercises most of<br/>
the system that I can test.  Not sure if that&#8217;s how Python people do their<br/>
testing, but it seems to be working good for me.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in trying it out, <a href='/projects/vellum/vellum-0.4.tar.gz'>grab the latest 0.4<br/>
release</a> or grab it from the bzr<br/>
with:</p>
bzr branch http://www.zedshaw.com/projects/vellum/
<p>The funny refactoring I did was to break up the one large class into<br/>
three smaller classes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>vellum.Press &#8212; Loads either <span class='caps'>YAML</span> or Python build specs and does the<br/>
&#8220;coagulate&#8221; needed to resolve imports.</li>
	<li>vellum.Script &#8212; Responsible for taking the results of Press and<br/>
building the internal executable data structures for the script.</li>
	<li>vellum.Scribe &#8212; Runs a script you give it according to the options set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, that joke has been choked to death and probably won&#8217;t get any funnier,<br/>
even if it ever was all that funny to begin with.</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s what you can do with Vellum&#8217;s new recipe stuff:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Put common tasks you have into other .yml (not .py yet) files.</li>
	<li>Put those common files into projects you start so you don&#8217;t have to<br/>
write them over and over again.</li>
	<li>Have your primary build.yml load them, and then the tasks and options in<br/>
the imported recipe file get put into a name space.  This means if you<br/>
have distutils.yml with a target of &#8220;clean&#8221; then your build.yml will have<br/>
a target of &#8220;distutils:clean&#8221;.</li>
	<li>You can put these files in other directories too and the slash will<br/>
apply to the namespace name.</li>
	<li>Since the main file can be a .py you can have it generate a .yml that<br/>
gets loaded as part of the configuration process.  This can be the start<br/>
of an autotools style config system (but one that doesn&#8217;t suck).</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll just be adding two tiny little things this next week and then I&#8217;m <br/>
gonna call Vellum 1.0 since it does most of what I need:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A path mechanism so that these common recipes can live in some central<br/>
place and referenced easily.  Then I&#8217;ll post up a bunch of recipes you can<br/>
grab and install for common stuff.</li>
	<li>Ability to have a recipe be a .py file so that they can get run like<br/>
.yml files during the resolution.</li>
	<li>Documentation and probably hosting the project on launchpad so people<br/>
can contribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href='/projects/vellum/'>Vellum project page</a> has more information and<br/>
a few more samples you can play with.</p></div></content><updated>2008-03-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-31.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-29.html</id><title type='text'>2008-03-29</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Well it was a busy day for me in Python land:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Created a <a href='/projects/vellum/'>project for Vellum</a> and <a href='/repository/vellum/'>bzr<br/>
repository</a></li>
	<li>Used Vellum to build Idiopidae, itself, my resume, and my web site.</li>
	<li>Added the ability to have condition guards that are just evaluated Python<br/>
expressions.  You can see in the sample build.yml files in the Vellum<br/>
source and project page.</li>
	<li>Reorganized Idiopidae so it puts things into a good namespace rather than<br/>
polluting.  Also included a bunch of missing files.</li>
	<li>The Vellum builds for my Python projects automate all the stuff you need,<br/>
including setup.py runs, cleaning, bzr commits, and nosetests.</li>
	<li>The -F option to Vellum will make it &#8220;force&#8221; all the conditionals, so<br/>
that it runs every target no matter what.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just have to add a good recipes mechanism and Vellum should be great.<br/>
I&#8217;m leaning toward a template system that lets you put a recipe on one of<br/>
your lines and the required options and that will generate new lines to be<br/>
run.  That or a simple way to just load other files and access that file&#8217;s<br/>
tasks in a namespace.  Or maybe both, gotta see what I need.</p>
<p>I was also talking with some friends, and they mentioned it&#8217;d<br/>
be great if Vellum could distribute the builds to multiple machines in such<br/>
a way that nobody needs to actually enter IP addresses.  I&#8217;ve always wanted<br/>
this too, but never thought of doing a build tool.  Now that I have a<br/>
fairly complete one, I think I&#8217;ll just try making this feature.  I don&#8217;t<br/>
really need something like this yet, but I can see having to run tons of<br/>
tests on the code in my book and all my projects.  Being able to push that<br/>
out to the many machines in my closet will be nice.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m thinking is using PyZeroConf or Avahi so that all the machines<br/>
will announce themselves and their roles, and then a master pushes the<br/>
Vellum script to them and runs targets using <span class='caps'>HTTP</span>.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;m really enjoying making stuff with Python.  <br/>
<a href='/projects/zapps/'>Zapps</a> is very useful for the little parsers<br/>
I want.  <a href='/projects/idiopidae/'>Idiopidae</a> is great for writing<br/>
the docs and working good for my book so far.  Now &#8220;Vellum&#8221; will<br/>
help build my book and all the required software in the <br/>
way I&#8217;ve always wanted these things built.</p></div></content><updated>2008-03-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-29.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-28.html</id><title type='text'>2008-03-28</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Announcing Vellum, the Python based make for books (or anything really).  I used Scons in<br/>
the past but I really didn&#8217;t like how huge and complex it was.  For something like building<br/>
a book in LaTeX using <a href='/projects/idiopidae/index.html'>Idiopidae</a> I needed just a very simple build thing, so I hacked one<br/>
up in about four hours (first version took 40 minutes).  For 142 lines of<br/>
fairly simple Python it&#8217;s already damn functional.</p>
<p>Right now it&#8217;s a single <a href='http://pastie.caboo.se/172103'>source file and a sample <span class='caps'>YAML</span> file named <em>build.yml</em>.</a><br/>
Here&#8217;s the sample <em>build.yml</em> I&#8217;m using for my resume:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
options: 
  default: build
  file: res3

targets:
  pdf: |
    dvipdf %(file)s.dvi

  dvi: |
    --&gt; echo {"file": "something else"}
    latex %(file)s.tex
    --&gt; echo {}

  echo: |
    &lt;&lt;&lt; Building %(file)s
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "opts: %s" % file

depends:
  build: [pdf]
  pdf: [dvi]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>What you see here is more of a sample then something realistic for<br/>
building a single LaTeX document.  It shows that options, targets, and<br/>
dependencies are in separate sections.  It shows that each target is just<br/>
a set of string lines with different startings (more on that later).<br/>
You&#8217;ll see the syntax &#8220;dvi: |&#8221; which is just how you tell <span class='caps'>YAML</span> that what<br/>
follows is a verbatim section.  You can also see that each line is handed<br/>
the options (plus command line settings) as a dict format so you can use<br/>
it to change the commands dynamically.  Notice also how &#8216;&#8212;&gt;&#8217; lines (which<br/>
run sub-targets) can take an optional dict that is merged into the main<br/>
options, letting you basically pass parameters.  Finally, notice that <br/>
you don&#8217;t have to put a target in the &#8220;targets:&#8221; section if it&#8217;s in<br/>
the &#8220;depends:&#8221; so you can have fake targets that just run others.</p>
<p>If you want to run this, just install<br/>
<a href='http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML'>PyYAML</a> first<br/>
and then make a <em>build.yml</em> file.  Run your build with <em>vellum</em> or use<br/>
<em>vellum -h</em> to see the available options.</p>
<p>It looks for a <em>build.yml</em> in the current directory or one you tell it,<br/>
builds the dependency graph, and then runs each target specified line by<br/>
line.  Pretty simple, but there&#8217;s a few interesting things about Vellum:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The targets, options, and dependencies are specified in separate sections, keeping<br/>
things flat the way Python people like it.  This also makes it easy to parse and process.</li>
	<li>It uses <span class='caps'>YAML</span> so it looks kind of like Makefile syntax.  Some Pythonistas say they hate <span class='caps'>YAML</span><br/>
but the result of a <span class='caps'>YAML</span> parse is just a dict, so I&#8217;ll include the option to just eval a .py<br/>
file that has the same data in it.</li>
	<li>It has very good error messages that tell you what line of what target caused a problem and<br/>
what the full problem was so you can fix it.</li>
	<li>It will print out all the targets and their dependencies so you can debug the graph if you need.</li>
	<li>It already has options for dry-run (-d), keep-going (-k), quiet (-q), and listing targets (-T).</li>
	<li>The part I think is the coolest feature is how it uses simple line prefixes to figure out what<br/>
to run.  &#8216;&gt;&gt;&gt;&#8217; means exec that line as Python.  &#8216;&lt;&lt;&lt;&#8217; means output that line as a message.  &#8216;&#8212;&gt;&#8217; means jump to that target and run it (so you can do out of order calls with alternative options hashes too).</li>
	<li>It will stop when there&#8217;s an error unless you say -k (keep-going).</li>
	<li>Dry run tries to do as much non-destructive processing as possible so you can debug the vellum script.  Combined with -q you can get a quick check of the script since it won&#8217;t print anything, but it will sys.exit(1) on error.</li>
	<li>You can list all the targets you want on the command line and it will run them in order with their dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main thing that&#8217;s missing is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A mechanism to indicate a test that has to be true in order for processing in that target to continue.  I may change &#8216;&lt;&lt;&lt;&#8217; from being &#8220;output&#8221; to being &#8220;exit on false&#8221;.  It would take a python expression that has to be true for processing to continue.  That would let you do the usual &#8220;only build .c if .o is older&#8221; and other tests.</li>
	<li>A simple recipe or extension system, and hopefully one that could snarf existing recipes from other build systems.  It&#8217;d be great if Vellum could be used as a meta-build system for people.  The goal on this is you&#8217;d be able to &#8212;&gt; to targets that other people would write, passing in options which would make it run things for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think with those two it&#8217;d be fairly complete, and even right now it works great for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be putting up a bzr repository sometime this weekend so if you&#8217;re interested in helping out or<br/>
just have ideas let me know.</p></div></content><updated>2008-03-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-28.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-26.html</id><title type='text'>2008-03-26</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Thanks for the jobs, banks blow, Zapps 0.2 out, and Idiopidae 0.2<br/>
released for all to play with.  Enjoy and read on&#8230;</p>
<p>First off, thanks to everyone who has emailed me with jobs for <br/>
my people at Bear Stearns.  I&#8217;ve received about 20 job offers<br/>
for them so far, so I think that&#8217;s enough.  That&#8217;s actually<br/>
quite a large number of jobs from just my blog so I&#8217;m thinking<br/>
of doing a blog post where I put these emails into a nice list<br/>
for anyone else interested.  Depends on if the original submitters<br/>
are into that or not.</p>
<p>At the moment though, I think I&#8217;ve got enough job offers for them<br/>
and anyone else who needs work in Ruby on Rails.  Thanks again.</p>
<h2>My Situation At Bear</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m actually doing fine with the whole thing.  It is bizarre having an<br/>
entire bank blow up under my feet right after I walk in the door, but so<br/>
was having hundreds or thousands of web sites use my software with nobody<br/>
interested in hiring me.  At least now I&#8217;m still getting paid and don&#8217;t<br/>
need to worry about what I&#8217;ll do next.</p>
<p>So far JPMorgan hasn&#8217;t done anything drastic so I&#8217;ve stuck around waiting<br/>
to see what happens.  As long as they don&#8217;t fuck things up further I&#8217;ll<br/>
probably at least ride out the transition to see what happens.  JPMorgan<br/>
is apparently offering insane cash to stay on during the transition, but<br/>
I&#8217;ve never been motivated by gobs of money.  My happiness is much more<br/>
important than buying crap.</p>
<p>One really big problem is the project I&#8217;m on is incredibly important<br/>
to people who need to be employed in the new regime.  My project is the<br/>
biggest ever for my department, has value outside of Bear, and uses <br/>
advanced technology.  There&#8217;s a good chance everyone can show off some<br/>
skills and get a chance to look good to their new masters.  It <br/>
turns out that what my team has built is pretty kick ass by Bear Stearns<br/>
standards, and that if I were to jet off to my next gig I&#8217;d screw<br/>
over everyone.</p>
<p>That means I&#8217;m stuck working for an industry that completely disgusts me<br/>
with their greed and working on a project that will eventually mean nothing to<br/>
JPMorgan. The alternative though (leaving) would screw over too many<br/>
people so I&#8217;m there for at least the transition.</p>
<p>I think having people&#8217;s jobs depend on my giving a fuck is<br/>
probably more stressful than being unemployed was.  Oh well.</p>
<h2>Zapps 0.2 Out</h2>
<p>I just put a new <a href='/projects/zapps/index.html'>release of Zapps</a> <br/>
for anyone who&#8217;s interested in a simple parser.  As I mentioned<br/>
before it&#8217;s a simple parser that I forked from Amit Patel&#8217;s <a href='http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/yapps/'>Yapps2</a><br/>
parser generator.  I&#8217;ve been slowly adding things I need to it<br/>
and cleaning up the code.  This release adds optional productions<br/>
to the grammar specification.</p>
<p><a href='/projects/zapps/index.html'>Hit the project page for download and bzr instructions.</a></p>
<h2>Idiopidae 0.2: First Official Release</h2>
<p>Idiopidae is my little book building tool for programmers.  It is similar to<br/>
noweb and cweb from the TeX world, but it follows the mantra: &#8220;code is code; prose is prose&#8221;.<br/>
That means you can document your software projects with Idiopidae without<br/>
having to do bizarre escaping sequences, copy-pasting code into your documentation,<br/>
or weird merging.  You only have to place consistent include/export comments<br/>
in your code and your prose, and then Idiopidae figures out how to merge them<br/>
together.</p>
<p>Big thing that Idiopidae does right now is correctly determine the format of<br/>
your prose and code, but still allowing you to override the guess.  Let&#8217;s say<br/>
you have a bunch of python in a script, but want one section to be in text format,<br/>
then you can do that.  If you also have an <span class='caps'>HTML</span> document and a LaTeX document<br/>
that are your prose, then Idiopidae will figure out the right format and <br/>
inject it correctly.  If you don&#8217;t like what it decides you just override it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll next be making it a bit nicer to work with, allow you to set options, and<br/>
create a simple make-for-python build system for your books.  I&#8217;m already using<br/>
it to document various projects into wiki text and <span class='caps'>HTML</span> formats with LaTeX<br/>
being worked on.</p>

even need to help some non-technical folks with manager <br/>
experience too. <a href='mailto:zedshaw@zedshaw.com'>Again, email me if you have anything.</a></p>
<h2>My Bear Stearns Employees Need A Job</h2>
<p>Well it looks like things are going very badly at Bear Stearns.<br/>
As usual, other idiots running the company fucked it up for <br/>
everyone else, and I really hope someone goes to jail for <br/>
this shit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have a few employees who work for me that will<br/>
potentially need new jobs.  I&#8217;m probably going to need one<br/>
too, but I&#8217;ve gotta look out for my people first.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m looking for Ruby on Rails jobs for <strong>other people</strong><br/>
who need to find work.  Do not contact me about a job unless<br/>
it is <span class='caps'>CTO</span> of a shit kicking company.</p>
<p>What they are interested in is Ruby on Rails, salary positions,<br/>
in the <span class='caps'>NYC</span> or Boston area.<br/>
The people on my team have very good skills in every aspect<br/>
of building out a project, and they&#8217;ve worked under me so they&#8217;re<br/>
battle hardened.</p>
<p>The project they worked on involved real world development,<br/>
including unit testing, continuous integration, agile<br/>
development, Vim, emacs, Linux usage, multi-platform development,<br/>
and the project is multi-discipline involving usability studies,<br/>
graphic design, protocol analysis, and system build-out<br/>
automation.  Huge parts of the system involved interactions with<br/>
Samba and understanding complex business logic related to<br/>
financial compliance and document storage for legal requirements.</p>
<p>These people worked on something much more complex and<br/>
detailed than any social network, so they can easily handle<br/>
your work.</p>
<p>And they did it all in less than about 5000 lines of code.</p>
<p>If you have potential gigs for anyone who works for me,<br/>
(<strong>not me!</strong>) then email me.  Head hunters welcome, but <br/>
I&#8217;d prefer direct hires.</p></div></content><updated>2008-03-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-17.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-16.html</id><title type='text'>2008-03-16</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><h2>How I Spent My PyCon Vacation</h2>
<p><img src='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/pycon_badge.jpg' alt=''/></p>
<p>This was done as a presentation at the lightning talk.</p>
<h2>Projects I Did</h2>
<h3>1) Worked on Zapps</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a parser generator that I forked from Amit Patel&#8217;s<br/>
Yapps2 parser.</p>
<h3>2) Python Idiopidae</h3>
<p>A book building system that will help keep code and book<br/>
separate but together.</p>
<p>You do this in code:</p>
<p>Then in your book:</p>
<h3>3) A Make Thing For Python</h3>
<p>Looking around, people kept saying they wanted a make system.<br/>
So I started one.  Got a rough idea that will look something<br/>
like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
do compile(build, hash="mtime"):
   "Builds a simple thing"
   [download, untar, test:run]
   { exists("something.txt") }
   &gt; cp /etc/passwd mybackup.txt
   file = open("mybackup.txt")
   &gt; rm mybackup.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You could probably get away with doing this without a parser.<br/>
Anyone interested in helping, let me know, since my Python<br/>
skill is weak like baby.</p>
<h3>easy_fucking_uninstall</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the shell code I have so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
easy_install -m $1
for i in `find /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ -name "$1*"`
do
  echo "Removing: $i"
  rm -rf $i
done
</pre>

<blockquote>
<pre> 

I'm looking for a co-founder/s (not employees, so there's no
money involved until at LEAST a demo is in place).

I supply:

1.  The idea that will give you a smug, warm glow on the inside
knowing you're making a better world for many by outsmarting some
of the "powers that be" at the top of society.

2.  The business model.  Money comes from users, users have the
money and a demonstrated history of willingness to pay for
similar, but vastly inferior type of services.

3.  An awesome identity.  Other people only delude themselves
into thinking their web 2.0 identities are awesome.  Mine
actually is.

4.  At least one solid financial contact who I've know personally
for about a decade and is very close to a lot of money overseas
which wants to invest in many things and couldn't care less about
a U.S. recession.

I AM LOOKING FOR AN ACTIVE, FULL OR EVEN PART-TIME COFOUNDER,
EITHER AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR AS A FIRM, TO HELP ME PUT TOGETHER A
WORKING DEMO; SPECIFICALLY:

1. A "37 Signals" approach to getting work started.  I am not a
bank.  I don't have a huge budget and a huge staff and this is
not a market which changes once every 20 years.  If you can't get
started hacking until you have a spec sheet that takes 8 months
to put together, then I would say I need more initiative and
know-how in a partner.

2.  An entrepreneurial nature, by which I mean the following: The
ability to PURSUE a PERCEIVED strategic opportunity regardless of
tactical considerations.

Action and adjustments, not endless planning sessions.

3.  An NDA - either directly or at first indirectly by someoone
you trust and can use as an intermediary to determine if you
should bother signing one.  

I am not a big fan of the "ideas are a dime-a-dozen, it's all
about execution."  I don't want to get into a debate.  People who
insist on this usually never actually had or came across a good
idea, and usually their ability to execute is far less than their
prima-donna personalities would have onlookers believe.

<a href='/projects/zapps'>Zapps project</a> to the world.  Zapps is<br/>
a fork of Amit Patel&#8217;s <a href='http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/yapps/'>Yapps2</a><br/>
that I&#8217;ll be using to do the Python Stackish parser and<br/>
<a href='http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/'>Utu</a> protocol design.  Yapps2 is a great little parser generator<br/>
that is easily hackable, so adding things like binary parsing<br/>
and improving the performance is very easy.</p>
<p>I contacted Amit about adopting the project, but he recommended<br/>
I fork it and even gave me the name: <em>&#8220;Zed&#8217;s Additional Python Parsing System&#8221;</em>.  I like it, and it&#8217;ll be a fairly small little project<br/>
amounting to some small tweaks and code cleanups to his.</p>
<p>This <a href='/projects/zapps/zapps-0.1.tar.gz'>0.1 release</a><br/>
mostly just moves the code around so that it works better<br/>
in distutils, and includes the stackish.g example files.<br/>
This is a fully functioning <a href='http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/stackish.html'>Utu Stackish</a><br/>
protocol parser producing the exact same data structure<br/>
as the comparable Ruby version.  This one however is <br/>
very accurate.</p>
<p>This release also introduces the start of a new production<br/>
for processing binary data.  In the Zapps grammar you can<br/>
include tokens that have <a href='http://docs.python.org/lib/module-struct.html'>python struct</a> syntax.  They don&#8217;t do anything now except<br/>
print the format out, but in the future you&#8217;ll be able to<br/>
put a binary unpacking token into the grammar and then <br/>
your parser will handle binary data and convert it <br/>
to your needed format.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also look at adding erlang style bitfields, although <br/>
those annoy the hell out of me.</p>
<p>The included stackish.g file also has an experimental <span class='caps'>BLOB</span><br/>
type modifier that lets you indicate a python pack format<br/>
rather than a size.  The size will be inferred from the<br/>
pack format, and then rather than a raw <span class='caps'>BLOB</span> type, you&#8217;ll<br/>
get a <span class='caps'>BLOB</span> that you can use to unpack the data.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you&#8217;d try it out:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
$ sudo python setup.py install
$ zapps examples/stackish.g
$ python examples/stackish.py
&gt;&gt;&gt; [ 'hhl:1234567890123456' '8:aaaaaaaa' test
Parsing: "[ 'hhl:1234567890123456' '8:aaaaaaaa' test\n"
[{'test': ['aaaaaaaa', (12849, 13363, 3906085646303834169)]}]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see this little shell example is taking your<br/>
Stackish and converting it to a consistent Python <br/>
data structure that matches it.  You can also see that <br/>
it takes the <span class='caps'>BLOB</span> of &#8216;aaaaaaaa&#8217; like you&#8217;d expect, but<br/>
then it unpacks the other blob according to the &#8216;hhl&#8217;<br/>
struct pack statement.  This gives you that tuple of numbers<br/>
which is <strong>very</strong> handy for passing packed structures inside<br/>
a parsed protocol.</p>
<p>Take a look at the <a href='/projects/zapps/stackish.g'>examples/stackish.g</a> file to<br/>
get a feel for how it looks.</p>
<h1>PyCon Baby</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be in Chicago from Thursday (14th) at around 9pm until<br/>
Monday 7pm attending <a href='http://www.python.org/community/pycon/'>PyCon</a>.  Gonna bring my camera and my laptop and<br/>
spend the whole time hacking and meeting people.  I&#8217;m also trying<br/>
to do some amateur anthropolog comparing the Python folks to <br/>
the Ruby people.  Should be tons of fun.</p>
<p>I reused my FooCamp login to create a <a href='http://pycon2008.crowdvine.com/'>PyCon2008 Crowdvine Account</a><br/>
that will serve as my <strong>only</strong> social network that isn&#8217;t encrypted.</p>
<p>If you are going, then drop me a line and let me know if you want<br/>
to meet up.  I&#8217;m down with meeting most anyone, even the really<br/>
crazy people.  The crazy ones are the most fun.</p>
<p>But please, if you send me an email, don&#8217;t try to emulate my<br/>
writing style.  It&#8217;s really hard to pull off the creative<br/>
&#8220;fuck&#8221; in an email, and when you guys try it you sound <br/>
really absolutely crazy.  I appreciate the attempt, but if you <br/>
want me to reply, try to tone down the crazy just a bit.</p>
<h1>Python Won&#8217;t Get You Laid</h1>
<p>Ruby guys are under some delusion that Ruby got me more pussy than a pimp in<br/>
a purple felt hat.  I realized this when they kept saying, &#8220;Oh, Python guys<br/>
are dorks and boring.  Nobody will think that&#8217;s hot.&#8221;  I was puzzled because,<br/>
well, Ruby guys are a bunch of boring dorks hiding behind a wannabe rock star<br/>
veneer.  They bounce around under this illusion that they&#8217;re going to be the<br/>
next huge startup by simple virtue of building their dumbfuck social network<br/>
based on someone else&#8217;s shitty <span class='caps'>MVC</span> framework.</p>
<p>But why would they care if some other group of coders are boring?</p>
<p>Then it hit me, they think Ruby is chock full of women and being<br/>
a Ruby programmer can get you tail.</p>
<p>Oh man, I need to tell you guys something:  Ruby didn&#8217;t get me jack<br/>
shit, my skills and style did.  Ruby didn&#8217;t do anything other than<br/>
surround me with greedy dumbfucks looking to take my effort and<br/>
flip it for a buyout by google.  Ruby is lame and languishing with<br/>
only its unjustified momentum keeping it going despite the shitty<br/>
interpreter all your crap rests on.</p>
<p>If the Python guys are boring, then that&#8217;s just fucking awesome.<br/>
So far, they&#8217;ve been a lot of fun to talk to online, even when<br/>
they disagree with me.  Not a single one has said &#8220;fuck you&#8221;<br/>
at all.  In Python &#8220;fuck you&#8221; is rare.</p>
<p>In Ruby land &#8220;fuck you&#8221; was known as &#8220;Tuesday&#8221;.</p></div></content><updated>2008-03-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-14.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-02.html</id><title type='text'>2008-03-02</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I&#8217;ve been working in the salt mines lately trying to get my project<br/>
out the door for the big mega-corp that pays my rent.  That and I&#8217;ve<br/>
been writing a lot in secret on my book or for other publications.<br/>
Most recently I did <a href='http://www.cio.com/'>an article for <span class='caps'>CIO</span> magazine on Ruby</a><br/>
titled <a href='http://www.cio.com/article/191000'>You Used Ruby to Write <span class='caps'>WHAT</span>?!</a><br/>
that amps up the irony of my blog even further.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been ignoring everyone and not writing on my <br/>
blog.  It&#8217;s funny but when I read people who comment about my blog,<br/>
they tend to say that I don&#8217;t write often enough for them.  That<br/>
I should just keep cranking out essay after essay for them to read<br/>
and enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s why most other blogs are crap.</strong></p>
<p>They try to write on a regular schedule and generally <br/>
just end up writing things nobody really wants to read.  When<br/>
people read my stuff (at least my ranting stuff) they almost<br/>
always say they read through the entire thing and enjoy all<br/>
of it.  When I read other blogs except <a href='http://collegecallgirl.blogspot.com/'>College Callgirl</a><br/>
I usually skim the first paragraph and then read the conclusion.</p>
<p>So, while I do take my time writing what I want to say, I<br/>
also try to make it the best writing I can and articulate<br/>
my opinions and thoughts entertainingly so people will read them and have<br/>
something to say.  Otherwise I&#8217;m just jerking off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy the <span class='caps'>CIO</span> article.  I may do more of these since they<br/>
pay pretty well for the work involved and it was a lot of fun.  I love the<br/>
irony of me advising a bunch of CIOs about when they should or should not use<br/>
Ruby.  Absolutely fucking awesome.</p>
<h2>PyCon This Month</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m going to <a href='http://www.python.org/community/pycon/'>PyCon</a> this year since I&#8217;m planning to do a lot<br/>
more professional and hobby work in <a href='http://www.python.org/'>Python</a> for now.  I started playing<br/>
around with it, found out that Python has an ass load of the things I need for the new<br/>
<a href='http://www.savingtheinternetwithhate.com/'>Utu</a> client.  The <span class='caps'>GUI</span> frameworks are very well done and complete, even the new ones trying<br/>
to take on <a href='http://www.wxpython.org/'>wxPython</a> or <a href='http://www.pygtk.org/'>PyGTK</a> for the<br/>
crown of &#8220;Official Python <span class='caps'>GUI</span>&#8221;.</p>
<p>One that I&#8217;ve found which I really like is <a href='http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python_gui/'>PyGUI</a><br/>
by Greg Ewing.  It has a simple Document oriented view of the world and does nice sane callbacks with<br/>
a small set of components.  It&#8217;s trivial to hook in OpenGL or 2D vector calls and works on multiple<br/>
platforms.  The documentation is also pretty decent, as I was able to produce <a href='/blog/word_wrap_pygui.py.html'>this fun piece</a><br/>
that uses a <a href='http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/'>word wrap and <span class='caps'>SMAWK</span> algorithm</a> from <br/>
D. Eppstein.  That tiny little bit of code implements a document viewer that opens any text file you<br/>
hand it, displays it word-wrapped (including hyphens) and then lets you click or shift-click<br/>
the mouse to increase or decrease the font.  That would have taken me forever to figure out and do in <strong>any</strong> other framework</p>
<p>That and my playing with <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com/'>Django</a>, <a href='http://www.bmsi.com/python/milter.html'>Python<br/>
Milter</a>, and<br/>
<a href='http://www.pygame.org/news.html'>PyGame</a> has been fun as hell.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another thing about Python that I liked:  <strong>I fucking learned it in<br/>
four hours</strong>.  I did Python programming many years ago when it was still green<br/>
and worked in it for about 3 months professionally so I had an advantage.<br/>
But with Python this time I <strong>only</strong> had to read the <a href='http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pythonpr2/'>Python Pocket<br/>
Reference</a> once and I could write<br/>
what you saw above.  I spent much more of my Python self-education browsing<br/>
code, reading about the community, checking out blogs, understanding<br/>
libraries, and finding out what&#8217;s new.</p>
<p>I think that statement requires repeating:  I didn&#8217;t have to buy any books to<br/>
become comfortable doing Python programming.  There is a whole ton of great<br/>
Python documentation, including complete books that you can use to learn it.<br/>
The books are well written and usually are also published in murdered tree<br/>
form for the old people with bad eyes.  This has helped me with my book buying<br/>
habbit more than you can ever imagine.</p>
<p>With Ruby I had to spend weeks slogging through code and reading that<br/>
shitfest Dave Thomas wrote.  Back then Ruby people (except Ryan Davis) were<br/>
really nice and fun.  Thinking back now I see why Ryan Davis was such a prick<br/>
to newbies like me since he probably saw the coming hordes of morons ruining<br/>
his little party.</p>
<p>I also still haven&#8217;t figured out why the fuck I was backing Ruby when the<br/>
Python guys clearly did a way better job at building their community and<br/>
infrastructure.  I kind of feel like I backed the wrong horse completely.</p>
<p>Oh, and try out <a href='http://vimperator.mozdev.org/'>Vimperator</a> if you<br/>
like Vim.  Actually check it out either way since it&#8217;s a great example<br/>
of giving people a rich <span class='caps'>GUI</span> interface that is still very keyboard<br/>
accessible.  I&#8217;d love to see someone take this same interface idea and<br/>
turn it into something for the blind.</p></div></content><updated>2008-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-03-02.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-02-05.html</id><title type='text'>2008-02-05</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><h2>Nothing Fucks Up Productivity Like Installing Linux</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t really drink, do drugs, or spend my money on anything other than<br/>
food and tech.  Most of the reason I play guitar is all the cool ass technology<br/>
you can buy for it.  So far I&#8217;ve got a <a href='http://line6.com/podx3/'>Pod X3</a> <br/>
that I plug a Line 6 Acoustic guitar into to fuck around.  Holy fucking shit I love<br/>
the Pod.  I also have a <a href='http://www.rolandus.com/products/productdetails.aspx?ObjectId=818'>Boss Micro BR</a><br/>
that sucks ass, a travel guitar that rocks, and other fun stuff.</p>
<p>Most importantly though I bought a new computer.  A desktop computer this time.<br/>
After 10 years I decided to go absolutely ape shit and setup what&#8217;s probably the<br/>
most insane computer setup I&#8217;ve used in a while.  I&#8217;ve only got one friend<br/>
who has something &#8220;better&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lookin&#8217; at all my stuff I figured I&#8217;d make this post about all the random<br/>
shit I&#8217;ve got going on that&#8217;s keeping me from doing the important awesome shit I should be doing.<br/>
Hell I have so much gear that I think I should just write about it<br/>
all and how I use it.  Until then I&#8217;ll just drop some random thoughts<br/>
about the last week and my ultra nerd heaven I&#8217;m building.</p>
<h2>Rubiverse Podcast With Me</h2>
<p>Mike Moore over at <a href='http://rubiverse.com/'>Rubiverse</a> has an interview with me<br/>
that he did right after I posted <a href='/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>Rails Is A Ghetto</a><br/>
which you can <a href='http://static.rubiverse.com/podcasts/4-zed-shaw-on-leaving-ruby.mp3'>download</a><br/>
in mp3 format.  Take a listen, and especially list to when I talk about conferences<br/>
and how I&#8217;d like to do something like the <a href='http://www.highlinefestival.com/'>Highline Festival</a><br/>
for geeks.</p>
<p>The podcast was a blast, and I must say the <a href='http://www.bluemic.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Products&amp;file=index&amp;prod_id=18'>BlueMic Snowball</a><br/>
I used fucking rocked.  I may start doing a podcast so all you nerds can hear me<br/>
scream some of these rants.  I&#8217;ve actually wanted to write and read my rants so that<br/>
even the blind can bask in my brilliance.  I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s what the blind need more<br/>
of in their lives.  Give them something to look forward to at the end of a hard day.</p>
<h2>It Hurt Like This The Last Time I Committed Suicide</h2>
<p>Which is to say, it hasn&#8217;t hurt at all.  Friends sent me this<br/>
link <a href='http://www.oreillymaker.com/link/9960/career-suicide/'>to an O&#8217;Reilly cover about how committing career suicide</a> which is actually a pretty awesome cover.  Yet, my <a href='/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>Rails Is A Ghetto</a><br/>
has done the inverse.  I&#8217;ve received offers from Microsoft, Google, <br/>
tons of start-ups, and I&#8217;ve been asked to keynote conferences&#8212;even Rails conferences.</p>
<p>Check it out.  I&#8217;ll be speaking at or going to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='http://www.rubyfringe.com/'>Ruby Fringe</a> &#8212; July 18-20, 2008 Toronto, Canada</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.caboo.se/articles/2008/1/30/caboose-conf-2008'>Caboose Conf</a> &#8212; May 29 &#8211; June 1st, Portland, OR. I think it&#8217;s a plot to kill me though.</li>
	<li><a href='http://rupy.eu/'>RuPy</a> &#8212; Apr 12-13, Poland.</li>
	<li><a href='http://www.python.org/community/pycon/'>PyCon 2008</a> &#8212; March 13-20, 2008, Chicago, IL.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m also writing an article for <span class='caps'>CIO</span> magazine about Ruby, and have had more contact with incredibly<br/>
cool people than ever before.</p>
<p>Overall, my open rip on dumbfucks has been nothing like a Career Suicide&#8482;.  I&#8217;ve got a whole<br/>
rant in the works as to why the hell programmers think that standing up for themselves will mean<br/>
they will &#8220;<span class='caps'>NEVER</span> <span class='caps'>WORK</span> IN <span class='caps'>THIS</span> <span class='caps'>TOWN</span> <span class='caps'>AGAIN</span>!&#8221;.</p>
<p>The best revenge of course is this:</p>
<p><img src='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/even_others_are_morons.jpg' alt=''/></p>
<p>Gotta love it.  Right after I see that I&#8217;ve got my own O&#8217;Reilly cover their<br/>
server crashes.  Yes, sorry, but <strong>some</strong> people I&#8217;ve worked with are morons, as well as <br/>
people I haven&#8217;t worked with.</p>
<h2>She Blinded Me With Science!</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve always had a hatred for people who claim that <span class='caps'>TDD</span> is so much better<br/>
and that it should be enforced on everyone with a Gestapo zeal.  There&#8217;s no<br/>
real evidence that it does better or worst than any other forms of testing, and<br/>
all of my statistical evidence and evaluation shows that it doesn&#8217;t actually<br/>
improve quality but rather just maintains what you have.</p>
<p>Enter <a href='http://scruffylookingcatherder.com/Default.aspx'>Mr. Skruffy</a> and <a href='http://scruffylookingcatherder.com/archive/2008/01/22/tdd-proven-effective-or-is-it.aspx'>his amazing Science tricks</a> who promptly takes<br/>
the first paper I&#8217;ve seen on evidence for <span class='caps'>TDD</span>, and tears it down quite easily.  What&#8217;s his secret?<br/>
See, he actually knows some statistics <strong>and</strong> he read the paper.  He simply went through the data<br/>
and evaluated it using his own brain to conclude that <span class='caps'>TDD</span> actually was worse in this case.</p>
<p>I love it when someone can use a paper&#8217;s own data to disprove the paper itself.  Lovely.  Again, got an<br/>
essay in the works on this one that will be more serious.</p>
<h2>Pol Pot Was Agile Too</h2>
<p>This <a href='http://mikemason.ca/'>Mike Mason</a> guy is a total fuck shit asshole.  Why?  Is it<br/>
because he&#8217;s from Canada?  Nah, Canucks are alright.  It&#8217;s because he seriously<br/>
<a href='http://mikemason.ca/blog/?p=19'>advocates firing all the original programmers once a startup makes it big.</a><br/>
Yes, you read that right.  He&#8217;s under the impression that the programmers that<br/>
started the company make it hard to become enterprisey so fire them.</p>
<p>In the middle of his post he has this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;As someone who&#8217;s written software at startups I know the pressures to get the next demo ready, to release the next feature for the web site. At that stage in the life of a startup we don&#8217;t even know if the company will survive another month.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whoa!  Hold up! That sounds like <strong>management</strong> is to blame for being a bunch of crackberry infected<br/>
dumbfucks who couldn&#8217;t plan a picnic to a fucking McDonald&#8217;s.  See people, when things are going<br/>
bad it&#8217;s always management&#8217;s fault.  Management hires the wrong people, dictates design when they<br/>
aren&#8217;t qualified, buys hardware that&#8217;s not needed, never listens to the experts they hired, makes insane<br/>
demands and plans, wastes money on useless shit, buys your chairs, your office, sets business direction,<br/>
<strong>everything</strong>!</p>
<p>If you want to fire someone, it&#8217;s management.  Fire the assholes who focused on making everyone cram<br/>
for some shitty demo to moron VCs instead of focusing on the quality of the mother fucking code in the first place.</p>
<h2>A Monstrosity Of A Computer Medusa</h2>
<p>I recently bought a <a href='http://www.velocitymicro.com/'>Velocity Micro</a> that&#8217;s sporting<br/>
a <span class='caps'>AMD</span> 64 Dual Core, Nvidia 512MB with dual head built-in, 500G drive, and a <br/>
<a href='http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01097300&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=de&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=3440923&amp;lang=en'>24-inch HP w2408</a> that compliments the 19&quot; I already have.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now sitting on my desktop staring at me, challenging me to make it do what I want.  I&#8217;m<br/>
slowly getting used to it, but my fucking god is that a lot of screen.  Before I used a laptop<br/>
so my setup was designed to give me the max out of a tiny viewport into my code.  Now that I can<br/>
have everything I need just right there on two screens I don&#8217;t really know what to do with my<br/>
setup.  It seems kind of useless, but I&#8217;ve got plans for some cool stuff soon.</p>
<p>I use <a href='http://www.archlinux.org/'>ArchLinux</a> as my primary desktop machine and I love it.  It <strong>never</strong><br/>
fucks up my installed software by overwriting it the way Debian or Gentoo has in the past.<br/>
Linux is the best lean mean coding machine there is, especially since you can customize and optimize<br/>
the fuck out of it.  Here&#8217;s just some of the software I use that makes my life trivial:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='http://awesome.naquadah.org/'>Awesome Window Manager</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://www.vim.org/'>Vim</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind'>Remind</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://www.newartisans.com/software/ledger.html'>Ledger</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://musicpd.org/'>mpd</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://gotmor.googlepages.com/dzen'>dzen2</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://www.fishshell.org/'>fish</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://swapoff.org/DevTodo'>devtodo</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/'>recoll</a></li>
	<li><a href='http://webgen.rubyforge.org/'>webgen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s just a bit of the stuff I use to make my super optimized coding and writing<br/>
desktop.  It pretty much only does that, with chat and other stuff in for good measure.</p>
<p>Linux however fucking sucks donkey cock when it comes to anything media.  Permissions on<br/>
nearly everything are all wrong or incomprehensible.  Sound cards are barely functioning<br/>
and difficult to configure.  Video is totally ghetto and even worse on 64bit because there&#8217;s<br/>
no Flash (so far) so I have to use <a href='http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/'>youtube-dl</a> and<br/>
<a href='http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html'>mplayer</a> to play them.  Composing music on it<br/>
sucks, playing music on it sucks, just about everything sucks.</p>
<p>Linux will not conquer the desktop this way.  But, I don&#8217;t use Linux for media and instead I<br/>
have a Mac Mini (good little machines) to play stuff, and an Apple TV for getting TV shows<br/>
and other stuff I want.  Nice thing is my new monitor <span class='caps'>HDMI</span> support so I just plug the<br/>
Apple TV in and use it when I want, rather than juggling cables and shit.</p>
<h2>Music Stuff</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve also recently purchased some cool gear for playing guitar.  I&#8217;m still rusty<br/>
and have been going back through the songs I know and relearning.  Like I said <br/>
in the beginning of the post I&#8217;ve got a bunch of <a href='http://line6.com/'>Line 6</a> gear<br/>
including their emulating acoustic guitar and the <a href='http://line6.com/podx3/'>Pod X3</a> to name<br/>
a few little things.</p>
<p>Line 6 does great technical music products that don&#8217;t seem super geeky but<br/>
inside pack a ton of great nerd qualities.  My guitar can emulate 9 other<br/>
guitars all with a physics modeling software system they developed, but it<br/>
doesn&#8217;t look like it has much extra gear on it.  It&#8217;s just a regular guitar.<br/>
The Pod is very small and built solid like it&#8217;s an old tube amp, yet it emulates<br/>
about 600+ different little devices and lets you mix the in a virtual mixing <br/>
board that&#8217;s very easy to use.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a whole thing on my music setup in my apartment full of pictures and how<br/>
I crammed it into a tiny little bit of space in the corner.</p>
<h2>Next Conference: Zed&#8217;s Suck Nerd Rock Fiasco</h2>
<p>One thing many people at conferences asked me to do was bring my guitar.  The problem is<br/>
my setup is put into a rack in the corner of my place.  I also don&#8217;t really play much<br/>
for other people since I&#8217;m really not that good.  I&#8217;m like an expert amateur at <br/>
best, if that.</p>
<p>But, you gotta give the people what they want.  I went to a few of the guitar shops <br/>
in <span class='caps'>NYC</span> and picked up this awesome <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Traveler-Ultra-Light-Travel-Guitar-Natural/dp/B000OQI2CI'>Traveler Guitar Ultra-Light</a> and I got a <a href='http://www.rolandus.com/products/productdetails.aspx?ObjectId=818'>Boss Micro BR</a><br/>
which means I&#8217;ll actually be able to bring enough of my gear around to play<br/>
at conferences.  That stuff, some headphones, and a harmonica and I&#8217;m set.</p>
<p>The Travel Guitar is the creepiest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen or heard.  It looks like<br/>
a fret board that&#8217;s got a pizza oven wooden spatula slapped on the end.  No knobs,<br/>
dials, or pickups.  You plug it into the Micro BR (or any amp) with a single patch cable<br/>
and it sounds like a full electric guitar.  It even plays nice considering its size.<br/>
Yet, I can&#8217;t figure out how this fucker works.  There&#8217;s no pickups and the strings<br/>
just bind into the body where the nuts are after passing over a plastic tube to<br/>
separate the strings.  It honestly looks like three chunks of wood and nothing else<br/>
yet sounds like it&#8217;s got three pickups.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like walking a talking dog.  It&#8217;s that weird.</p>
<p>That Micro BR though sucks shit.  It&#8217;s billed as this portable studio that lets you<br/>
load an SD card with MP3 or <span class='caps'>WAV</span> files so you can play along with them.  I was already<br/>
doing this on my computer and it really makes learning a song easy.  However, every<br/>
MP3 I play in the Micro BR locks it up, and it just plain refuses to play WAVs at all.<br/>
I&#8217;m using <a href='http://lame.sourceforge.net/index.php'>Lame</a> to do the encoding and no<br/>
matter what the bit-rate or the settings the Micro BR still locks up.</p>
<p>It does come with an MP3 and a free SD card that works, so I&#8217;ve got a chance to narrow<br/>
it down, but come the fuck on.  MP3 has been around for ages and there&#8217;s plenty<br/>
of great embedded libraries and chips for processing it.  If your programmers<br/>
suck so fucking bad that they can&#8217;t properly decode and MP3 to play in your little<br/>
player then go the fuck home.  And if you say your thing plays <span class='caps'>WAV</span> files then<br/>
fucking play them.  At least the <span class='caps'>WAV</span> files just say <strong>&#8220;Unsuported Format&#8221;</strong> rather<br/>
than locking up the machine.</p>
<p>Not being able to put MP3 files on the thing to play along kind of removes about 1/2<br/>
of its value.  It&#8217;s still pretty handy for recording simple 4-track songs, but <br/>
my main reason for getting it is to play along with those songs or to try learning<br/>
more music that doesn&#8217;t have sheet music with it.  My ear isn&#8217;t so good so I was<br/>
looking to try a fun geek solution.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll have to debug the fucking thing for Roland and then write them a nice<br/>
fucking rant about who they should fire for being an incompetent asswipe.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the other rant I&#8217;m writing about programmers.</p>
<h2>Idiopidae Has A Bar</h2>
<p>Kashif Rasul sent me an email after he read my post about Idiopidae and showed me<br/>
what he&#8217;s been doing with <a href='http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=xetex'>XeTeX</a><br/>
in his own works.<br/>
I swear it&#8217;s the best typeset code I&#8217;ve seen.  <a href='/uv.pdf'>Here&#8217;s a sample</a> that<br/>
has a Textmate look to it.  Compared to <a href='/text-test.pdf'>my latest output</a> I&#8217;ve got <br/>
a long way to go.  There isn&#8217;t a publisher on the planet that can print<br/>
that for cheap, and I don&#8217;t really like the color formatting in a book, but the<br/>
typography is great.</p>
<p>He might work with me on Idiopidae when I get it usable and may help bring some<br/>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working on a redesign of <a href='http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/'>Utu</a> to try out using something like a <a href='http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/Linda/NotesLinda.NM.html'>Linda TupleSpace</a><br/>
that is nothing but a giant encrypted distributed hash table with the hate being modeled as <br/>
&#8220;friction keys&#8221; on the slots.  Going through the math it should work a lot easier than<br/>
the previous queues off structure routing, but I&#8217;ll have to try it out.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s making this new design possible and even easy is the introduction of <a href='http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html'>libev</a><br/>
and <a href='http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/index.html'>Tokyo Cabinet</a> including a few other things.<br/>
These two libraries actually will make a new version of Utu smaller and use less weirdness while<br/>
letting me try out the friction mapping concept.</p>
<p>The concept is pretty simple.  All of the actors on the hub communicate via a distribute<br/>
tuble space controlled by the hub, but each slot of the hashtable has an arbitrary number of<br/>
keys any user of the slot must know.  Some of the keys however are unknown but easily breakable<br/>
if you go through the <a href='http://savingtheinternetwithhate.com/design.html'>Utu hate process</a> to find the key. Simple.</p>
<p>One of the motivations for the redesign is that while doing room based chat is easy with the queues, <br/>
the structure routing is weird to people, and the queues don&#8217;t work so well for P2P messaging.  They&#8217;re<br/>
also harder to distribute out to multiple machines as any <span class='caps'>IRC</span> sysop will tell you.  A tuple space is<br/>
much easier to cluster and it can support either P2P messaging or chat room style.  It does take up<br/>
more space though, but that&#8217;s always the trade off.</p>
<p>Finally, my designer friend is hooking me up with a fun new <a href='/utuweb.jpg'>design for the Utu site</a><br/>
that also include a vector based mascot named Moko:</p>
<p><img src='/blog/moko_utu_mascot.png' alt=''/></p>
<p>He&#8217;ll be featured in the new application.  I&#8217;ll be doing up the new site<br/>
design very soon and putting up the latest and greatest on Utu for all the<br/>
people interested in following.  Stay tuned.</p>
<h2>Gigantor Kindness Monster</h2>
<p>Bradley Taylor took a quote from my <a href='/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>Rails Is A Ghetto</a> rant<br/>
and turned it into <a href='/gigantor_kindness_monster.mp3'>a funny as fuck mp3 about the gigantor kindness monster</a><br/>
that sounds like a black Christopher Lambert.  Rock. The. Fuck. On.  As soon as I can I&#8217;m<br/>
going to get a sample of that into a song or make it my bootup theme.</p>
<h2>Caught Up!</h2>
<p>Man, that&#8217;s a lot of links.  That should get me caught up with all the stuff I wanted<br/>
to post little blurbs about.  I can&#8217;t stand the links lists other bloggers post<br/>
so hopefully everyone like this format.  Let me know.</p>
<p>And no assholes, I didn&#8217;t get paid for any of those links.  I like the tech that I use <br/>
and want to share with people so fuck off.</p>
<p>Watch for my article in <span class='caps'>CIO</span> magazine where I&#8217;m actually telling a bunch of CIOs what<br/>
Ruby is good for in the Enterprise.  Believe it or not I&#8217;m probably the best qualified<br/>
person for that job.</p></div></content><updated>2008-02-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-02-05.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-30.html</id><title type='text'>2008-01-30</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Well, I&#8217;ve got Idiopidae (my alternative to <a href='http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/'>noweb</a>) working for parsing up the sections of my book<br/>
and importing code.  Factor and the <span class='caps'>PEG</span> parser setup by <a href='http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/'>Chris Double</a><br/>
do a decent job of this.  This means that I can actually<br/>
inject code from arbitrary source files into my LyX or TeX documents and<br/>
have it typeset.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a problem:  it looks like shit as just plain text.<br/>
One of the reasons I&#8217;m working on Idiopidae is that I can&#8217;t stand<br/>
the way most code is injected into books.  Either the code is<br/>
pasted in by hand, the author makes a &#8220;build system&#8221;, or they<br/>
use something like noweb.</p>
<p>Pasting in by hand sucks because, as the software evolves <br/>
(which mine will for sure) someone has to update all those<br/>
little code snippets.  It&#8217;s error prone, disgusting, ugly, and<br/>
I refuse to do it.  Full stop.</p>
<p>Noweb and <a href='http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/cweb.html'>cweb</a> <br/>
suffer from the problem that since the code and the prose are in<br/>
one file, that file looks nothing like the code or the prose.<br/>
Instead it&#8217;s this mind boggling escape festival that &#8220;magically&#8221;<br/>
produces the real source files for both the book and the software.</p>
<p>WTF.  My book should look like my book and work like my book.  My code<br/>
should look like my code and work like my code.  There&#8217;s no reason<br/>
I can&#8217;t use some of that advanced compiler technology known as &#8220;import&#8221;<br/>
and &#8220;export&#8221; to make a system that can merge the two for me based on<br/>
statements in both.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m building Idiopidae.</p>
<p>With the problem of how to import/export sections of source code into<br/>
the book solved (mostly) I wanted to get the formatting of the source<br/>
sexy.  I&#8217;ve always hated how source is laid out in most books: Usually<br/>
in nasty fonts without any syntax highlighting, and never any color.</p>
<p>Lucky for me <a href='http://factorcode.org/'>Factor</a> has a great xmode library that can process about<br/>
100 programming languages and produce a token stream, and it already<br/>
had a code2html library that produced <span class='caps'>HTML</span> output.  I just had to<br/>
learn xmode and then write a similar converter to TeX&#8217;s nasty ass<br/>
format.</p>
<p><a href='http://paste.factorcode.org/responder/pastebin/show-paste?n=3'>Here&#8217;s the Factor code, Ruby sample, and TeX output.</a><br/>
It&#8217;s a paste so don&#8217;t expect it to be around long.  I&#8217;ll <br/>
have more when it&#8217;s all working though.</p>
<p>You can see it&#8217;s not much code and what it produces is already<br/>
quite nice.  <a href='/text-test.pdf'>Here&#8217;s a sample <span class='caps'>PDF</span></a> I&#8217;ve been<br/>
playing with.  The first block is just some sample TeX commands<br/>
for the types of formatting I can do.  After that is the above<br/>
mentioned Ruby code injected into that document.<br/>
The original source document is <a href='http://www.lyx.org/'>LyX</a> but I had to do a bit of<br/>
hand retouching since Idiopidae isn&#8217;t quite there yet.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s kind of nice is since there&#8217;s already a code2html<br/>
in addition to my new code2tex I can inject formatted and named sections of<br/>
code as either TeX or <span class='caps'>HTML</span>.  I&#8217;m hoping that&#8217;ll make<br/>
writing about code on my blog easier too.</p>
<p>Next up is to figure out what&#8217;s the best font structure to use,<br/>
how the hell TeX escapes stuff, and then how to go about doing<br/>
fast builds of large books or chapters with Idiopidae.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, TeX is dogshit.  It may produce great results, and maybe there&#8217;s<br/>
LaTeX, but without <a href='http://www.lyx.org/'>LyX</a> I wouldn&#8217;t touch it manually.  Any language that has so<br/>
many ways that different symbols must be escaped is just nasty.  So far,<br/>
&#8216;_&#8217;,&#8216;{&#8217;,&#8216;#&#8217;,&#8216;}&#8217;, and &#8216;|&#8217; must all be escaped differently and in different ways<br/>
depending on the context.</p>
<p>I love Knuth&#8217;s books, but I may just skip his book on parsing if<br/>
this is how he does it.</p></div></content><updated>2008-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-30.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-18.html</id><title type='text'>2008-01-18</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><h2><span class='caps'>CUSEC</span> 2008 Rocked Hard!</h2>

<p>I was kind of joking around about <a href='/blog/2008-01-13.html'><span class='caps'>ZSFF</span></a> but <a href='http://subwindow.com/articles/4'>Erik Peterson</a><br/>
grabbed it and went with it showing how it&#8217;s just simple enough<br/>
to work well.  He even <a href='http://subwindow.com/zsff/validator'>wrote a validator</a><br/>
with ruby source (on the link).  His validations go quite a bit<br/>
further than I intended but that&#8217;s a really great job.  The <span class='caps'>ZSFF</span> Ghetto Reader I had in the works actually worked with his .zsff file right away,<br/>
and my feed passed his validations.</p>
<p><strong>Now that&#8217;s team work!  Go Team!</strong></p>
<p>I of course had to throw my own 2am hack job <a href='/blog/zsff_ghetto_reader.rb'><span class='caps'>ZSFF</span> Ghetto Reader</a> (save as dork&#8230;) which is the kind of code I <strong>love</strong> writing when I&#8217;m<br/>
tired and bored.  No stupid unit tests.  No code quality.  No thought<br/>
about what it should do first.  No diagrams.  Just a quick hack to do<br/>
a little thing I want real quick that I tinker with for fun.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t work if you don&#8217;t have <a href='http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/'>Epiphany</a> since I hate waiting for Firefox to load.</p>
<p>Now, a few folks said, &#8220;Waaaah! Booohoooo! How do I get the real text of your<br/>
site Zed?!  It&#8217;s so damn important that I put every single bit of your ranting<br/>
goodness into my aggregator so that I can make a mint off your words.&#8221;</p>
<p>Understanding that most programmers aren&#8217;t good enough to parse <span class='caps'>HTML</span><br/>
and find all the H and P tags&#8230;  Wait.  Ehem.  Understanding that XPath<br/>
and <span class='caps'>XML</span> parsing sucks so bad most programmers can&#8217;t use it to easily<br/>
find all the H and P tags I decided to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The <a href='/feed.zsff'><span class='caps'>ZSFF</span></a> for my site now includes the .page file that has the raw<br/>
<a href='http://hobix.com/textile/'>Textile</a> for each blog post.  The <span class='caps'>ZSFF</span> Ghetto<br/>
Reader will recognize that you&#8217;re grabbing a .page file and just show that in<br/>
the <em>more</em> program.  If you&#8217;re blind you should like this quite a lot since<br/>
you can just stream it through a text-to-speech reader probably easier than<br/>
<span class='caps'>HTML</span>.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m really sick of this ruby code for generating my atom feed.<br/>
It mostly works but I&#8217;m too lazy to master something that should be<br/>
dead easy.  Therefore, I&#8217;ve made one last change to my feed.rb<br/>
file that just makes the <a href='/feed.zsff'><span class='caps'>ZSFF</span></a> and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>If you do your news as a <span class='caps'>YAML</span> then <a href='/blog/feed.rb'>this feed.rb</a> file<br/>
is a good start for you probably.  It&#8217;s again another 2am hack I done<br/>
up to just get something done, but I&#8217;m going to just do a new one<br/>
in Factor and a good <span class='caps'>ZSFF</span> reader too that&#8217;s all graphical and shit.<br/>
Maybe screencast how you make a <span class='caps'>GUI</span> in Factor since I&#8217;ve been<br/>
getting into that.</p></div></content><updated>2008-01-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-14.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-13.html</id><title type='text'>2008-01-13</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><h2>Back To Black, Introducing <span class='caps'>ZSFF</span></h2>
<p>The first cut of the site was more like this.  All black background<br/>
and a few little images and elements.  I decided to go back to that and<br/>
to touch up a few things here and there, but mostly the same old site.</p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s impressive is just how small this layout is and yet<br/>
still it functions nearly everywhere.  I may never do another <span class='caps'>CSS</span><br/>
only layout again.  I&#8217;m starting to wonder how the fuck we got sucked<br/>
into that crap, especially if the only way to really get a good<br/>
looking layout with <span class='caps'>CSS</span> and div tags is with mountains of stylesheets,<br/>
html, and sometimes some damn javascript.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not kidding about the javascript.  I&#8217;ve seen people desperately<br/>
trying to force their square-peg 3 column layout through the <span class='caps'>CSS</span> <br/>
round hole resort to javascript tricks to force the columns in<br/>
the right spots.</p>
<p>C&#8217;mon now, if just switching to a damn table gets the job done then<br/>
fuck your stupid pride and do it.  It&#8217;s not gauche to do what&#8217;s easiest<br/>
and nobody&#8217;s going run you out of Designer Town (population 100) with<br/>
sharpened pitchforks and blazing torches.</p>
<p>Obviously now that I&#8217;ve changed the layout it&#8217;s going to not work<br/>
for some asshole with IE 5.0.  Oh well.</p>
<h2>Atom Feeds Suck</h2>
<p>News readers are picky.  The order of the elements matters.  The<br/>
format of URLs matters.  The date format matters.  Every tiny little<br/>
brittle piece of Atom and the 10+ <span class='caps'>RSS</span> standards matters.</p>
<p>Yet, all I want is for a damn chunk of news to show up in my stupid<br/>
reader like it&#8217;s email.</p>
<p>After struggling to get the atom feed to work for all the people who<br/>
use Nazi readers I started to think:  why the hell are we using feed<br/>
formats like this?  Could it be done simpler?</p>
<p>Taking a look at the various formats, I&#8217;ve decided that I want <br/>
this format:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It&#8217;s a fucking flat file based on the <span class='caps'>HTTP</span> standard.</li>
	<li>First line is a version header.</li>
	<li><span class='caps'>HTTP</span> style headers follow that, but simplified.  These set info like Author,<br/>
Title, Subtitle, etc.</li>
	<li>An empty newline then a set of URLs <strong>only</strong> separated by newlines.  Top one is most recent.</li>
	<li>The URLs have to be universally unique and simply point at the damn news in<br/>
<span class='caps'>HTML</span> format.</li>
	<li>It&#8217;s the news reader&#8217;s job to keep track of what it&#8217;s seen and show new<br/>
stuff, no matter what order these URLs are in.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to call this format <strong>&#8220;Zed&#8217;s <span class='caps'>STFU</span> Feed Format&#8221;</strong>.  I&#8217;ll be writing<br/>
a set of libraries to implement this pretty soon.  Anyone interested<br/>
in helping out just ping me and I&#8217;ll hook you up when I get it going.</p>
<h2><span class='caps'>ZSFF</span> Starter Sample</h2>
<p>I took the 10 minutes it takes to parse this and then another 10 to figure out I fucked it up, but look at the annotation in this simple<br/>

<p>Here&#8217;s some things about him:</p>
<ul>
	<li>And also known as littledan in #concatenative on irc.freenode.org.</li>
	<li>He is usually very helpful and knows way more about Factor than I<br/>
do.</li>
	<li>He&#8217;s actively working on Unicode for Factor as well as several other<br/>
libraries.  His blog posts on Unicode are pretty good as well.</li>
	<li>He maintains the <span class='caps'>FAQ</span> for Factor and works on much of the<br/>
documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dan will be coming in from out of town, and will be leaving the next<br/>
day.  He&#8217;s looking to hack with people interested in Factor, talk about<br/>
coding in general, ask people about working in <span class='caps'>NYC</span>, and probably do a<br/>
bit of teaching.</p>
<p>After that, I was thinking we could hit a spot or two around Union<br/>

that I can&#8217;t quite figure out.  Randomly some pages from the site will render<br/>
as a binary stream rather than as the actual content.  I believe it&#8217;s the gzip<br/>
encoding getting messed up but I&#8217;ve gotta debug it.</p>
<h3>The Emails</h3>
<p>Only a few more left, hangs out as I answer, and I&#8217;ve got<br/>
a new rant in the works.  Stay tuned.</p></div></content><updated>2008-01-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-09.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-08.html</id><title type='text'>2008-01-08</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Bam! This is the new <span class='caps'>ZSFA</span> look thanks to a fun graphic designer who probably<br/>
wants to remain anonymous.  It&#8217;s the same basic template but with some<br/>
sliced up graphics and tables all 1997 style.  Love it.</p>
<p>It must have been my listening to <a href='http://www.fatpossum.com/artists/jones.html'>Paul &#8216;Wine&#8217; Jones</a><br/>
all day that inspired the tables.  Well, that and <span class='caps'>CSS</span> was designed<br/>
by a bunch of crack monkeys with no concept of algorithmic layout and<br/>
consistency.  Dammit why didn&#8217;t they read anything Knuth wrote? Why?</p>
<p>When changing my layout to some tables shaves off 300% of the complexity<br/>
I begin to wonder why I bother with today&#8217;s <span class='caps'>HTML</span>.  I think I&#8217;m going to<br/>
explore just how simple I can get the <span class='caps'>HTML</span> and <span class='caps'>CSS</span> by rejecting all<br/>
that Zen <span class='caps'>CSS</span> bullshit the lemmings are following.</p>
<p>I took a break from replying to emails, but I still have about 100<br/>
to go.  I can&#8217;t wait to drop my next rant on you guys.  It&#8217;s going<br/>
to be tons of fun and involves Tina Turner.</p>
<p>If you sent me a job offer I&#8217;m still replying in person, but I&#8217;m<br/>
going to turn it down.  I&#8217;m doing good where I&#8217;m at right now, assuming<br/>
they don&#8217;t can my sorry butt soon for my rock star quality blog here.</p>
<p>I swear man, if people don&#8217;t get that my writing and ranting is <br/>
at least 1/2 joke I&#8217;m gonna just give up.  It&#8217;s supposed to be<br/>
funny to be mean to people!  At least that&#8217;s what the internet<br/>
has taught me.</p>
<p>Enjoy!  Let me know if it looks like crap in Safari or IE.</p>
<p>Wait, fuck that, I don&#8217;t care about Safari and IE is only<br/>
good for wiping dog shit off the bottom of my shoe before<br/>

they&#8217;re great.  There&#8217;s so many people who&#8217;ve ran into the exact<br/>
same things I talked about in my rant that I&#8217;m planning a series<br/>
of more serious essays around the evils of the software industry.</p>
<p>I may be contacting some of you to ask if I can include your stories<br/>
in my essays.  If anyone has stories about getting screwed by<br/>
political bullshit, stupid people, or just bad businesses then<br/>
send them my way.  Let me know if I can include them in my<br/>
next essay.</p>
<p>One thing I think everyone should read is this short essay <br/>
by Rickard Ãberg entitled <a href='http://www.jroller.com/rickard/entry/psychopaths_in_the_software_industry'>Psychopaths in the software industry</a><br/>
about a process called Ponerization.  He gives an excellent<br/>
perspective on how companies can get this way because of <br/>
psychopathic weirdos who infiltrate your company.</p>
<p>Finally, there was only 2 hate mails I had to deal with so far<br/>
which makes me feel good.  In the &#8220;blogosphere&#8221; (god I hate that<br/>
word) people seem mixed leaning more toward me being a moron and <br/>
and asshole.  However the emails are great and all supportive.</p>
<p>Except those 2, and man those two were morons.  The best one<br/>
was a guy who emailed me from a hotmail account saying he had<br/>
an <span class='caps'>MBA</span> and he was a way better coder than me.  I quick google<br/>
found that he was a fat obnoxious .<span class='caps'>NET</span> coder living in Orange County.<br/>
Even found his myspace page.</p>
<p>Just in case people are thinking of sending me hate mail, here&#8217;s<br/>
what my response was (minus his identity):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
: Read your rant and I only have one thought.  Fuck you. 
: I have an MBA and I can probably code circles around your ass 
: and not get wrapped up in pissy arguments over technology in the process.
:  
: Take a midol dude..
:

So, you email me from a hotmail account and you're probably this
shithead:

*cut LOTS of google hits off his email.* 

Looks like you're probably some fat fuck living in the OC who thinks
he's hot shit in a champagne glass when really you're just warm piss in
a dixie cup.

And the day some piss ant little cock sucking fuck nut .NET coder like
you is better at just about anything is the day I toss myself off a
bridge.

So far, all you've got to back up your goddamned piece of shit ego is
two little postings on some fucking message boards.  Your MBA is nothing
but a yuppie green card that lets you work at some giant company so you
can blow the people above you and treat the people below you like shit
because you're a clueless fucking moron who had his spine removed in
ECON 501.

Next time you decide to email me make sure you've gone out and paddled
your fat ass around for a while so that the canoe shapes your ass well
enough to fit in your mother fucking chair and you can write something
longer than three sentences.

</blockquote>
<p>Amazing how he not only gets wrapped up in the pissy argument, obviously<br/>
can&#8217;t code for shit, but also proves that MBAs are morons.</p>
<p>Other than that wonderful gem I&#8217;m pretty happy with people&#8217;s reactions.</p>
<p>Now to finish these emails and write a new essay.</p></div></content><updated>2008-01-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-06.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-04.html</id><title type='text'>2008-01-04</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Wow, I&#8217;ve received a ton of fan mail over my <br/>
<a href='http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>Rails Is A Ghetto</a> rant.<br/>
So much that I&#8217;ve decided to contact everyone and say<br/>
thanks and actually reply.  Then I may contact a <br/>
few people to ask if I can include their questions<br/>
in a larger <span class='caps'>FAQ</span> of sorts.</p>
<p>I actually only received 1 hate mail, and maybe<br/>
three that were on the fence.  I find that astounding<br/>
since all the blog-moron-focusing-devices like slashdot<br/>
seemed to be full of nothing but scorn and mild<br/>
ridicule.  Man, slashdot ain&#8217;t what it used to be.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the <a href='http://factorcode.org/'>Factor</a><br/>
hack fest tomorrow at 7pm @ Earth Matters on 175 Ludlow St.<br/>
I&#8217;ll be there and a few others and I&#8217;ll go over <br/>
the 50 most important words (and how you get them<br/>
with a single line of Factor code).</p>
<p>If you wrote me an email and I haven&#8217;t responded<br/>
then just give me a day or two.  It was around<br/>
400 emails and I still have like 300 to go.</p>
<p>One guy sent me an email that made my mail<br/>
client prompt me for a password in a weird way.<br/>
Still trying to figure out how he forged the<br/>
headers to do that, but thanks for trying the<br/>
hack man.</p>
<p>Finally, some people have asked me how my<br/>
site survived a redditing, a techcrunching,<br/>
and a slashdotting plus all the other hits.<br/>
It&#8217;s very simple:</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t run Rails.</strong>  I actually use another<br/>
very nice Ruby project called <a href='http://webgen.rubyforge.org/'>webgen</a><br/>
that generates the entire site, blog, feeds<br/>
and all that offline, and then I rsync it onto<br/>
a tiny 256M VM donated by <a href='http://railsmachine.com/'>RailsMachine</a><br/>
This is then served up by <a href='http://nginx.net/'>nginx</a> as<br/>
pure static content.</p>
<p>The most important point is my little VM didn&#8217;t break a<br/>
sweat during the whole thing.  My nginx didn&#8217;t use <br/>
more than about 4M ram the whole time and I only had<br/>
one worker going.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how you do it boys and girls.  I&#8217;ll have a<br/>
more detailed blog post with stats this weekend<br/>
for everyone who&#8217;s interested in getting a similar<br/>
setup.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p></div></content><updated>2008-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-04.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-03.html</id><title type='text'>2008-01-03</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Done with the <a href='http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>Rails Is A Ghetto</a> <br/>

compared Rails/Ruby to <span class='caps'>COBOL</span> when it was actually ColdFusion.  Like<br/>
that matters since it&#8217;s still stupid.</p>
<p>Additionally, this rant has the other things I wanted to say.  Praise<br/>
to the people I did like.  Praise for an actual good product<br/>
ThoughtWorks did called <a href='http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence'>Mingle</a><br/>
through their studios.  And finally more personal confession <br/>
from myself to keep things honest.</p>
<p>Well, read through the rant, flame away babies because<br/>
I done gone.</p>
<p>See everyone at the Factor hack Friday!</p></div></content><updated>2008-01-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-03.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-02.html</id><title type='text'>2008-01-02</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>First, I&#8217;m organizing a <a href='http://factorcode.org'>Factor</a> hacking<br/>
session at <a href='http://www.healthylivingnyc.com/find-it/business/802/3'>Earth Matters</a><br/>
on <strong>Friday Jan 4th @ 7pm</strong>.  If you wanna hang out and hack, learn some<br/>
Factor from a newb like me, and probably go hit a few of the bars<br/>
down here after, then show up.  We&#8217;ll be in the back where<br/>
the tables are with computers because we&#8217;re all nerds.</p>
<p>Second, while everyone else spent the day posting my little rant<br/>
all over the internet and writing their blog posts, I went out<br/>
to wander the city and see a movie.  When I came back (and a little<br/>
before I left) I decided rather than finish the rant today I would <br/>
instead reply to <strong>every</strong> email I was sent.  That&#8217;s over 100 messages<br/>
(some long, some short) from people all over.</p>
<p>I must say I&#8217;m impressed just how much people liked and identified<br/>
with this rant.  Everyone was very encouraging and really seemed<br/>
to care.  Other people had their own takes on the situation or<br/>
questions which I answered honestly.  I think the best was finding<br/>
out from a junk yard owner how it&#8217;s just like that for him too.</p>
<p>Some things that people probably would like to know before I<br/>
finish the rant:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, I have a job, but I&#8217;m very happy people are helping me out by offering work.</li>
	<li>Yes, I&#8217;m perfectly sane and quite alright.  Anyone who knows me gets the<br/>
joke, the rest are just part of the joke.</li>
	<li>e07e8e6e51bc6d169070b5cb468ca200  (Only Franklin will get that one).</li>
	<li>I am <strong>not</strong> blaming Ruby on Rails for all of my troubles.  My troubles are my own doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last part is very key, so it&#8217;s going in the rant tomorrow.  I am 90% responsible<br/>
for all of my pain and troubles during the last year.  My rant is more about how<br/>
getting stuck in the Rails community made it much harder to recover from my<br/>
own dumbassery, and how fucking annoying the dumb ass pricks really are.</p>
<p>When I say that &#8220;Mongrel killed my career&#8221; keep in mind that I wrote Mongrel,<br/>
started to suspect it would kill off my work chances, and kept working on it<br/>
because I was attached to it.  Recruiting a group of solid coders to maintain<br/>
Mongrel for me was probably the most important change I made, both for myself<br/>
and for everyone who benefits from my software.</p>
<p>So, when I post the continuation of the rant in the next few days, keep this <br/>
in mind.  I&#8217;m not looking for a pity party, just looking to turn the kitchen<br/>
lights on so the cockroaches run under the fridge.</p>
<p>Enjoy your day everyone!</p></div></content><updated>2008-01-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-02.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-01.html</id><title type='text'>2008-01-01</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Happy New year people!  While everyone was reading my <a href='http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html'>in-progress rant</a> and enjoying <br/>
it I went to this awesome place called <br/>
<a href='http://www.p-ong.com/'>P*ong</a> with my sexy new girlfriend.  We ate a prix fix 10<br/>
course meal with some very tasty samplings of the different desserts and <br/>
savory foods Mr. Pichet Ong makes.  It was really cool because we just stumbled<br/>
in, looked like a cool place, they sat us up at the bar, and we hung out for<br/>
two hours talking with the chef.  Very fun and low key way to bring in the<br/>
new year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be finishing off the Rant tomorrow for anyone that&#8217;s interested, and will<br/>
also do a few follow-ups.  Most importantly I want to do another rant that <br/>
points out the heroes of the Ruby community so that they get credit.  There<br/>
are some incredibly good creative programmers in the Ruby world but the mass<br/>
of mundane idiots and blow hards drowns them out like wet rats.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also currently working on the statistics section of my book to be an <br/>
<a href='http://www.pearsonhighered.com/'>Addison Wesley</a> short cut.  This chapter<br/>
is a combination of learning <a href='http://www.r-project.org/'>R</a> and how to<br/>
apply statistics to analyze the behavior of systems.  So far it&#8217;s a very <br/>
simple introduction that will give you three key tools which are used<br/>
in the rest of the book, and it&#8217;s geared to programmers through R.</p>
<p>So far everyone&#8217;s loving the rant and the new site, so thanks for the <br/>
support folks and enjoy your day off.</p></div></content><updated>2008-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2008-01-01.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2007-12-31.html</id><title type='text'>2007-12-31</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I&#8217;ve been having some fun with <a href='http://factorcode.org/'>Factor</a> lately both<br/>
learning their very fun new way to code and also expanding my brain with<br/>
their new concepts.  I just stayed up until 5am hacking on<br/>
<a href='http://paste.factorcode.org/responder/pastebin/show-paste?n=65'>this pathetically small little script.</a></p>
<p>What this little bit of factor contains is the start of a project I&#8217;m<br/>
calling Idiopidae after <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopidae'>this burrowing spider</a> <br/>
I like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of like <a href='http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/'>noweb</a> but done so that I don&#8217;t have to <br/>
cram my source inside <a href='http://www.zedshaw.com/book/index.html'>my book</a> or put<br/>
my book inside my source.  Instead, Idiopidae will allow me to put special import and<br/>
export statements in my <a href='http://www.lyx.org/'>LyX</a> source and my project&#8217;s source<br/>
and then it&#8217;ll figure out how to merge them into the final output for the book.</p>
<p>The thing is, that 70 or so line script does a ton of stuff that you<br/>
might not notice:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It pulls a file into memory and parses each line, converting based on whether it parses using<br/>
that <span class='caps'>EBNF</span> grammar.  The hope is that I can expand the commands available to do more things.</li>
	<li>That whole <span class='caps'>EBNF</span> is actually parsed on the fly to build a parser using the<br/>
<span class='caps'>PEG</span> library by <a href='http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/'>Chris Double</a>.</li>
	<li>Correctly sections off documents that have exports in them, including creating anonymous<br/>
sections for the regions without any identifiers.</li>
	<li>During the import processing side it will leave any accidental export and end statements alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same file in Ruby was a big hack job that didn&#8217;t do any parsing so it wasn&#8217;t quite as smart.</p>
<p>Now, this damn file took me about 7 hours to write, and it took me probably months to get<br/>
even that far with Factor.  Not really because Factor&#8217;s hard, but mostly because I didn&#8217;t<br/>
have any time at all to play with it apart from reading code.  Forcing myself to work on a<br/>
project like this will help me learn faster (I hope).</p>
<p>Some things that I&#8217;m finding very nice about Factor is the listener and the error checking.<br/>
The listener is kind of like Factor&#8217;s workbench (or the irb you always wanted).  The error<br/>
checking, while at first hard to decipher, helps you spot places where in <span class='caps'>FORTH</span> you&#8217;d be<br/>
screwed like unbalanced branches and invalid stack effects.  Both of those helped me get<br/>
my head around my code until I was easily fixing very weird bugs with a little thought.</p>
<p>Thanks to the #concatenative channel on irc.freenode.org and especially littledan who<br/>
gave me a sweet chunk of code that was the basis of this file.  Those guys totally rock.</p></div></content><updated>2007-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2007-12-31.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2007-12-29.html</id><title type='text'>2007-12-29</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>I posted this to the Lua mailing list when I saw a discussion about <br/>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>I normally don&#8217;t contribute on the Lua list, just a lurker who uses it<br/>
in commercial and non-commercial projects.  I read your comments here<br/>
and thought I&#8217;d toss out some wisdom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an open source developer who operates in the Ruby world with a<br/>
foot in Java, Python, and lately the Factor community.  I&#8217;m also a<br/>
professional sofware developer and have worked as a contractor for<br/>
large and small companies in many different industries, and currently<br/>
work for a bank using open source projects.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to do is give you a little bit of advice that might<br/>
help you understand two important things about open source:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Why what you&#8217;re asking for (and kind of demanding) is going to<br/>
irritate most creative projects.</li>
	<li>How you can get what you want cheaper and more accurately<br/>
as long as you do some of the work.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; (What&#8217;s wrong with setting a schedule where once a year a new release version comes out with up-to-date bug fixes and non-dramatic features appear?  As long as Lua keeps meeting this deadline, for even minor, minor adjustments, there&#8217;s no question about the future.  As has been pointed out, the MBAs aren&#8217;t going to know the differences behind the code.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a <a href='http://www.zedshaw.com/essays/c2i2_hypothesis.html'>long essay</a> on a very simple concept<br/>
that I&#8217;m going to compress for you so you can understand the dynamic at work<br/>
here.</p>
<p>Imagine I break software development clients into two camps:<br/>
Collaborators and Customers.  Now imagine I then break projects into two<br/>
categories of Implementation and Invention.</p>
<p>Collaborators will participate daily and know what&#8217;s going on because<br/>
they are there and will usually pay variable price because of a higher<br/>
tolerance of risk. Customers just want something packaged, want it now,<br/>
and will only pay a fixed price and if it isn&#8217;t perfect they&#8217;ll bitch.</p>
<p>Implementations are things you&#8217;ve done a billion times or that you can<br/>
manufacture with a consistent process and have low risk and low<br/>
variability. Inventions are done different every time, require creative<br/>
thinking, adaptation to randomness and chaos, and generally are riskier<br/>
and variable.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, you pair Collaborators with Inventions, and<br/>
Customers with Implementations.  The other combinations end in<br/>
disasters and you really only find them in the corporate world where<br/>
the force of tons of cash can make those bad mixes work anyway.  In the<br/>
open source world where Darwin rules, the good projects gravitate<br/>
toward Collaborators + Inventions or Customers + Implementations, with the<br/>
former more common than the latter.</p>
<p>The reason some people might get upset at you is that you are saying<br/>
(or what they hear) is, &#8220;I&#8217;m a Customer dammit and I want my<br/>
Implementation planned with no risk now.&#8221;  That&#8217;s ungrateful and<br/>
irritating and insults their hard work.</p>
<p>Yet, the Lua community and developers say, &#8220;We are Collaborators<br/>
working on a grand Invention and will do what we want for the art.&#8221;<br/>
That&#8217;s also insulting as it says you have to be a programmer illuminati<br/>
to participate at all.</p>
<p>This is just the way it is, and the best projects have learned to<br/>
balance the two and still have fun and be creative in their own ways.</p>
<p>Now, this hopefully answers the first question:  You can&#8217;t get<br/>
what you want this way because Lua is not a product to be implemented.<br/>
Lua is an invention that is constantly adapting and changing, and yes<br/>
at the whims of its collaborators.  And, generally you can&#8217;t have it<br/>
both ways.  To much implementation style (read: planning) in an<br/>
invention style project and you lose the collaborators.  I know, I&#8217;ve<br/>
left better projects for that many times.</p>
<p>And, this should hopefuly give you insight into the answer to the<br/>
second question.</p>
<p>If you want to know exactly what&#8217;s going on, then you have to become a<br/>
collaborator in the invention, not a demanding customer of an<br/>
implementation.  When you do this&#8212;by contributing code, bug fixes,<br/>
documentation, extra projects, and chatting with the people&#8212;you get a<br/>
real time full feed of exactly what&#8217;s going on and can have a chance to<br/>
influence decisions.</p>
<p>The tools are all there as well.  You can track the source, the blogs,<br/>
the projects on Lua Forge, the mailing lists, the <span class='caps'>IRC</span> channels.  Hell,<br/>
a smart man like yourself could probably craft a wicked &#8220;Lua Tracking<br/>
Console&#8221; to do just this and be 100% tapped into the community you need.</p>
<p>Then, when you then go to bid, being able to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a major<br/>
contributor to the Lua project and creator of 16 Lua based<br/>
projects with a direct line to the Lua community.&#8221;  does much better<br/>
than if you had a time line full of lies from Roberto.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div></content><updated>2007-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2007-12-29.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2007-12-28.html</id><title type='text'>2007-12-28</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>Dropped a wad on a collection of <a href='http://www.fatpossum.com'>Fat Possum Records</a> albums.

<p>I can&#8217;t wait for <a href='http://fatpossum.securesites.net/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=A&amp;Category_Code=25'>Junio Kimbrough&#8217;s</a><br/>
albums since I&#8217;ve been obsessed with some of his songs covered by <a href='http://fatpossum.securesites.net/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=A&amp;Category_Code=3'>The Black Keys</a>.</p>
<p>I also think it&#8217;s fucking insane that <a href='http://fatpossum.securesites.net/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=A&amp;Category_Code=6'>Cedell Davis</a><br/>
is wheel chair bound and only has one working hand so <strong>he plays with slide<br/>
guitar with a butter knife</strong>.  Yes, a butter knife.  I love that man already.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll do up some reviews of these as I listen and see if I can pick up some<br/>
of the songs.  The other arists on the list are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='http://fatpossum.securesites.net/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=A&amp;Category_Code=33'>R.L.  Burnside</a> most famous for doing the Soprano&#8217;s opening song.</li>
	<li><a href='http://fatpossum.securesites.net/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=A&amp;Category_Code=32'>Paul &#8216;Wine&#8217; Jones</a> reviews of his two albums were good so I picked him up.</li>
	<li><a href='http://fatpossum.securesites.net/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=A&amp;Category_Code=45'>T-Model Ford</a> who actually killed a man once, served time in prison and said, &#8220;Prison made T-Model a good man.&#8221;</li>

Have almost everything <br/>
organized and laid out, but since it&#8217;s a big book I&#8217;ve been cycling over<br/>
it and refining things.</p>
<p>Another thing I&#8217;ve done is created a new project (soon to be published)<br/>
called Idiopidae after the trapdoor spider.  What this little tool does is<br/>
allow me to inject parts of actual source code accurately into my<br/>
<a href='http://www.lyx.org/'>LyX</a> document using <a href='http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/'><span class='caps'>GNU</span><br/>
source-highlight</a><br/>
<a href='http://www.latex-project.org/'>LaTeX</a> translation.  It can do whole files or<br/>
sections partioned by comments.</p>
<p>Yes I know about &#8220;noweb&#8221; and friends, but their syntax blows and they<br/>
have the fatal flaw of requiring me to hack my code inside their<br/>
disgusting syntax.  Instead, Idiopidae keeps my prose in one file and<br/>
my code (fully runnable) in a separate file, then it does the job of<br/>
putting it all together at the end.</p>
<p>This tool is saving me a ton of work, and for fun I decided to rewrite<br/>
it in Factor from the hack job I did in Ruby.  Once it&#8217;s working I&#8217;m <br/>
gonna release it for everyone to play with and hopefully it&#8217;ll help<br/>
other people trying to writ technical books.</p></div></content><updated>2007-12-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><link href='http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2007-12-26.html' rel='alternate'/></entry><entry><id>http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/2007-12-25.html</id><title type='text'>2007-12-25</title><content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><p>The resurrection of my blog is complete.

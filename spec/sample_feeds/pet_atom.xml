<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017d3f3c6976970c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Sentry Calming Collar for dogs" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c017d3f3c6976970c" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017d3f3c6976970c-250wi" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Sentry Calming Collar for dogs" /></a>With all of our kids home for the holidays our house has turned in to Grand Central Station. The abundance of noise and chaos agitates our very sensitive Great Dane, Shakespeare, to the point that he jumps up on folks, paces back and forth, and barks for no apparent reason. A super time to test <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/109324/Sentry-Calming-Collar-for-Dogs.aspx" target="_blank" title="Sentry Calming Collar for dogs">Sentry&#39;s Calming Collar for dogs</a>!</p>
<p><strong>The claim:</strong> Sentry claims that the collar helps dogs in fearful or stressful situations (separation anxiety, fireworks, thunderstorms, visitors, new baby, traveling, pulling on leash, whining, chewing, aggression, incessant barking). The collar mimics pheromones that mother dogs produce to calm and reassure her puppies. The collar releases pheromones for up to 30 days and is non-toxic. </p>
<p>Watch the <strong><em>Science Behind the Pheromones</em></strong> video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEDGdvwEp60&amp;feature=relmfu">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEDGdvwEp60&amp;feature=relmfu</a></p>
<p><strong>The test:</strong> Upon opening the collar&#39;s packaging I was greeted with the pleasing scent of lavender and chamomile. There was quite a bit of powdery residue that fell from the collar when we first opened it which the box states activates the &quot;pheromone technology.&quot; The generous 28&quot; collar fit easily around Shakey&#39;s neck with collar to spare which we snipped off with scissors.</p>
<p>The following day, as family members began pouring through the door, we paid close attention to Shakespeare&#39;s behavior waiting for the jumping, pacing and barking to begin, &quot;when much to our wondering eyes did appear&quot; a very calm and shockingly stress-free pup. Even our&#0160;3 year old granddaughter&#39;s boisterous behavior failed to get so much as a twitch out of our gentle giant. We were simply amazed!</p>
<p><strong>Final word:</strong> We found the <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/109324/Sentry-Calming-Collar-for-Dogs.aspx" target="_blank" title="Sentry Calming Collar for dogs">Sentry Calming Collar for dogs</a> did live up to its claim to calm our fretful, furry family member and would strongly recommend it to anyone with a fearful or anxious pup. </p>
<p><strong>Where to buy:</strong> The Sentry Calming Collar for dogs can be purchased in-store and online at most pet supply retail stores including <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/109324/Sentry-Calming-Collar-for-Dogs.aspx" target="_blank" title="Sentry Calming Collar for dogs">Petco.com</a> for $9.99.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://yads.zedo.com/ads2/c?a=1339743;g=0;c=809000000;i=0;x=8192;n=809;s=2;k=http://www.mypet.com/dogflu" target="_blank"><img alt="Dog Flu (Canine Influenza)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c017c32997d05970b" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017c32997d05970b-300wi" style="width: 300px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Dog Flu (Canine Influenza)" /></a><br />If you&#39;ve ever wondered if your dog can get the flu, the answer is yes! While it&#39;s not the same strain of flu virus that humans contract, it&#39;s just as serious and worthy of special shout-out to my followers.</p>
<p><strong>About dog flu</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Canine Influenza is a very serious threat to dogs and its symptoms can easily be confused with <em>Bordetella </em>(canine cough).</li>
<li>Canine
influenza only affects dogs and cannot be passed to humans.</li>
<li>The
virus that causes flu in dogs—canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N8—was first
identified in January 2004. Dog flu cases have now been reported in 39 states. </li>
<li>Because
most dogs have no natural immunity against CIV, virtually all dogs exposed to
the virus become infected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risk factors for dogs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Just
like <em>Bordetella</em>, dogs that spend time
at boarding facilities, doggy daycares, groomers, dog parks, and group training
are at a high risk of contracting canine influenza.</li>
<li>Many
facilities that require vaccination against <em>Bordetella</em>
(canine cough) are beginning to see the benefit of also requiring vaccination
against canine influenza. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The
most common sign of dog flu is a soft, wet cough that may last for 3 to 4
weeks. Other signs include fever, runny nose, fatigue, and loss of appetite.</li>
<li>Like
human flu, dog flu can lead to more serious conditions like pneumonia. Up to 8%
of dogs that get the flu can die from the infection.</li>
<li>Recognizing
the signs of dog flu is not enough to prevent spreading the disease.
<ul>
<li>About
20% of infected dogs will show no signs of disease but can still spread CIV to
other dogs.</li>
<li>By the time a CIV-infected dog shows signs
of illness, the dog is likely to have stopped spreading the virus.
<ul>
<li>Prior to showing
signs of illness, dogs can spread CIV to surrounding objects, which become
sources of infection, as well as directly to other dogs.</li>
<li>Dog flu cannot be diagnosed by signs
alone. A veterinarian will need to perform blood tests to determine
if a dog has the flu.<strong> <br /></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How you can protect your dog against the flu</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaccinating
your pet is the best way to protect him/her against CIV.</li>
<li>The
first CIV vaccine approved in 2009, Nobivac<sup>®</sup> Canine Flu H3N8 from Merck
Animal Health,
has been shown to reduce the spread of disease among dogs.</li>
<li>Owners
should talk to their veterinarians and see if their dog’s lifestyle merits
vaccination.</li>
</ul>

We&#39;ve bombed with a variety of cat toys but it was a happy day indeed when my daughter brought home an A-Door-able kitty toy to amuse them.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017d3cb68d21970c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Atticus and his new favorite toy!" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c017d3cb68d21970c" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017d3cb68d21970c-200wi" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Atticus and his new favorite toy!" /></a>You simply clip the (plastic coated) hanger on any door frame and let the hilarity begin! Scout and Atty went absolutely bonkers over this thing. I couldn&#39;t believe how long it kept their attention. The first time I put it up they must have played with it for over an hour.</p>
<p>The little toy hangs at the end of an adjustable elastic cord and makes a rattling sound when bounced. We have the mouse but I see that the octopus and bird are catnip scented. We&#39;ll have to try one of those next!</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.petcarerx.com/search/search.aspx?q=A-Door-Able" style="float: right;" target="_blank"><img alt="A-Door-able Bird" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c017ee42c32dd970d" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017ee42c32dd970d-150wi" style="width: 140px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="A-Door-able Bird" /></a>Atty and Scout attack the mouse and upon release, the elastic cord flings it high in the air in random directions. Occasionally I have to retrieve it from the top of the microwave. I kind of wish it squeaked but I suppose that would drive me crazy after about 20 minutes. It also has a breakaway safety clip which I think is an absolutely awesome feature!</p>
<p>We LOVE this toy! So often, it&#39;s the simplest toys the cats love the best!</p>

So many new products to check-out, including their latest pet carrier design, the Curvations Pet Tote. We like the hip design, the sleek look, comfy padded shoulder strap and, the removable, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">washable</span> pet bed. </p>

Beyond being very
cute and stylish it comes completely apart to store easily, the sides have full
zippers to be able to put your dog in and take out easily, a pet bed inside,
ventilation all the way around the carrier, a shoulder strap and carry handle,
in addition to feet on the bottom of the carrier.&#0160; It really is very well
made and designed I would highly recommend this to anyone traveling with their
pet!&quot;</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017d3c6d1f16970c-pi"><img alt="Fat Cat Foodies &amp; Kitty Hoots Boogie Mat" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c017d3c6d1f16970c" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017d3c6d1f16970c-320wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Fat Cat Foodies &amp; Kitty Hoots Boogie Mat" /></a></p>
<p>The Boogie Mat is a fun splash of color with whimsical designs that makes me smile even though I&#39;m knee deep in kitty litter clumps. At 13&quot; by 16½&quot; it&#39;s small enough to toss from spot to spot yet large enough to protect my couch while Indy indulges in a little catnap.<br /><br />Indy loves the crinkly sound it makes as she walks across it or rolls around on it and the aroma of the Zoom Around the Room Organic Catnip (included) provides the pièce de ré·sis·tance. Our new rescue kittens are still learning the lay of the land but I suspect they&#39;ll conspire to steal the Boogie Mat from big sister once they&#39;re settled in.</p>

cranky.&#0160; She is not usually interested in anything, but she loves this
mat.&#0160; It has become her &#39;spot&#39;.&#0160; </p>
<p>It has a zipper on the side where
you put in the catnip and it makes a crinkling sound when she steps on
it.&#0160; </p>
<p>She plays with it, sleeps on it, and protects it from the dogs in our
house!!&#0160; It is so cute to see her acting like a kitten again!&#0160; Must
be the catnip!!&#0160; We will definitely keep this around filled with fresh catnip!!&quot;</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.solvitproducts.com/products-ls798_1_ls-i87_i.aspx" target="_blank"><img alt="Solvit Products" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c017d3c44034d970c" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017d3c44034d970c-300wi" style="width: 300px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Solvit Products" /></a><br />
<span style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: small;">It was a good day when we
received the <a href="http://www.solvitproducts.com/products-ls798_1_ls-i87_i.aspx" target="_blank" title="Solvit Kitty&#39;scape">Solvit Kitty’scape Deluxe Cat Tower</a>.&#0160; The unique thing about the Kitty’scape
concept is that its parts can be assembled in a variety of ways. You can have a
wide structure or can build a tower that reaches up over five feet.&#0160; </span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thepetonline.com/cat-furniture-c-550.html?osCsid=72927e7dd316a855004432ab2c5d7e63" style="float: left;" target="_blank"><img alt="Atticus chillin&#39; on the Kitty&#39;scape" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017ee3b9f523970d-150wi" style="width: 140px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Atticus chillin&#39; on the Kitty&#39;scape" /></a><span style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: small;">We had fun with the Kitty’scape. First we
experimented with building a low, wide structure, but then we changed it into a
tall tower. Our kittens, Atticus and Scout LOVE their Kitty’scape Cat Tower!
They especially enjoy the penthouse canopy at the top of the structure, as well
as the higher platforms. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: small;">
This is an excellent quality
product. The parts are stout plastic or wood, and clearly well made. They all
fit together properly, and everything was in the box that was supposed to be.
Our Kitty’scape Deluxe Cat Tower was easy to assemble and everything we hoped
it would be. It was fun to be creative with how we put it together. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: small;">
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.thepetonline.com/cat-furniture-c-550.html?osCsid=72927e7dd316a855004432ab2c5d7e63" style="float: right;" target="_blank"><img alt="Scout &amp; Atticus playing on the Kitty&#39;scape" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c017c321691f2970b" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017c321691f2970b-150wi" style="width: 140px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Scout &amp; Atticus playing on the Kitty&#39;scape" /></a>Kitty’scape really is a unique
design for a cat play structure, and was easy to assemble.&#0160; Comparatively, <a href="priced" target="_blank" title="Solvit  Products">Solvit Kitty’scape products</a>
are quite competitive in price. We tested the deluxe kit, which retails for
$150. You can also get the Intermediate Kit for around $105 and the Basic Kit
for around $75. If you wish, you can get other accessories, such as the
Scratching Plate and the Adventure Bridge, the Hammock, and a variety of other
expansion parts. <br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: small;">This is a fun product that is competitively </span>priced<span style="font-family: Century Gothic; font-size: small;">, of good quality and most important, FUN for your cats!
Atticus and Scout recommend it heartily!</span></p>

lucky liver treats for Cesar&#39;s serene supervision as we delved deeper
into the canine psyche. Only two episodes left and we&#39;re here to tell you that they were worth the wait!</p>
<p>Tonight&#39;s episode, &quot;Hollywood Hounds&quot; features fitness guru, <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.jillianmichaels.com" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Jillian Michaels (personal trainer)">Jillian Michaels</a>, and her <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/chihuahua" target="_blank" title="Chihuahua Breed Profile">Chihuahua</a>, Richard, who is in desparate need of a mental &quot;chill pill.&quot; Jillian is in the process of adopting a two year old daughter and doesn&#39;t want to fear for her new babe&#39;s safety around her pup.</p>
<p>Next we visit <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.kelseylive.com/" rel="homepage" target="_blank" title="Kelsey Grammer">Kelsey Grammer</a> and his wife, Kayte, whose dogs, Elvis and George, have a propensity for pottying indoors rather than dirtying their outdoor play-space. Will Cesar be able to save the day <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> the carpet?</p>
<p>In next Saturday&#39;s episode, &quot;Cesar&#39;s Worst Bite,&quot; Cesar comes face to face with Holly, a <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/labrador-retriever" target="_blank" title="Labrador Retriever Breed Profile">Lab</a> pup with some serious food aggression issues. Cesar learns first-hand just how dangerous this pooch&#39;s problem is when he is rushed to the hospital after sustaining a bad bite. </p>
<p>In Cesar&#39;s next case we meet Lenie, pregnant and homeless, with an opportunity to make a fresh start courtesty of a women&#39;s shelter that is willing to take-in her and her beloved <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/american-pit-bull-terrier" target="_blank" title="American Pit Bull Terrier Breed Profile">Pit Bull</a>, Tucker. But will Tucker&#39;s protective nature keep Lenie from making a better life for her and her unborn baby? Can the <a href="http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/nat-geo-wild/full-episodes-1/dog-whisperer-1/" target="_blank" title="Dog Whisperer Videos">Dog Whisperer</a> work his magic and keep this family together?</p>
<p>Tune in to <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/wild/dog-whisperer/" target="_blank" title="The Dog Whisperer on Nat Geo Wild">Nat Geo Wild</a> tonight, September 8th, and next Saturday, September 15th, for the exciting, final installments of our favorite Dog Whisperer, Cesar Milan!</p></div>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.mythreecats.com/products/bolt-laser-interactive-cat-toy-new" style="float: left;" target="_blank"><img alt="FroliCat BOLT Laser Toy from MyThreeCats.com" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c017744706ede970d" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c017744706ede970d-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="FroliCat BOLT Laser Toy from MyThreeCats.com" /></a><a href="http://www.mythreecats.com/products/bolt-laser-interactive-cat-toy-new" target="_blank" title="BOLT Interactive Laser Toy">BOLT</a> is one of the best names they could have come up with for this toy. &#0160;I have two extremely playful cats and when they hear me tap on the laser and call their names they come running. &#0160;
They literally &#0160;Bolt from their naps and start chasing the little red pin
point laser everywhere.</p>
<p>You can place it anywhere, turn on the timer and let it go. &#0160;I especially&#0160;&#0160;like the tilt-able mirror which changes the height of the laser. &#0160;When it is on high they jump from one chair to another and on low they slide all over the wooden floors trying to catch the dot!</p>
<p>I really like having the option of either holding the <a href="http://www.mythreecats.com/products/bolt-laser-interactive-cat-toy-new" target="_blank" title="BOLT Interactive Laser Toy">BOLT Laser Toy</a> in my hand to manipulate the laser dot or setting the 15 minute timer.</p>
<p>The only suggestion I would make would be to not place it on the floor and leave. &#0160;The cats are so curious they just want to get up close and see the laser which is not good for their eyes! It is definitely worth buying as it is sturdy enough to last forever!</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.bynaturepetfoods.com/productpages/catmain.php" target="_blank"><img alt="By Nature Natural Pet Foods" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c0167684cbb16970b" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c0167684cbb16970b-300wi" style="width: 300px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="By Nature Natural Pet Foods" /></a>Cats are notoriously finicky eaters and the members of our Kitty Review Crew are no exception. We&#39;re never quite sure how they&#39;re going to react to new foods or treats, however their reaction to an unguarded bag of <a href="http://www.bynaturepetfoods.com/productpages/catmain.php" target="_blank" title="By Nature Adult Cat Formula">By Nature&#39;s Adult Dry Cat Food</a> left on the living room floor made their opinions quite clear.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://www.bynaturepetfoods.com/productpages/catmain.php" style="float: right;" target="_blank"><img alt="Exhibit A: Buddha and the torn bag of By Nature cat food" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a010535222d03970c01761641ef0d970c" src="http://www.obama-dog.com/.a/6a010535222d03970c01761641ef0d970c-200wi" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Exhibit A: Buddha and the torn bag of By Nature cat food" /></a>I submit the photo (right) as Exhibit A. As you can see, I found the bag of food covered in tiny tooth marks, torn open, and missing a considerable amount of its contents.&#0160;</p>
<p>Evidently they found the aroma drifting from the bag irresistible and became obsessed with devouring it&#39;s crunchy bounty. Breaking into the food before the review is our cat&#39;s way of saying, &quot;WE LUV DIS FUD!&quot;</p>
<p>I like the fact that By Nature&#39;s <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.petsecretshopper.com/2012/06/gama2-airtight-vittles-vault-stackables.html" rel="autointext" target="_blank" title="Gamma2 | Airtight Vittles Vault Stackables">pet foods</a> (both dry and canned), are all natural, contain real chicken, beef, and turkey with no soy, wheat, or corn. There&#39;s an interesting article on the ByNaturePetFoods.com website that explains <a href="http://www.bynaturepetfoods.com/nutrition/pdf/bynature-whats-better-chicken-or-chicken-meal.pdf" target="_blank" title="Chicken meal vs non-rendered chicken">why chicken meal is better than &quot;non-rendered&quot; chicken</a>. I had no idea!</p>
